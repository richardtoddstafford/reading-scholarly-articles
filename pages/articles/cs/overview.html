Computer science and IT are relatively young disciplines that evolve
rapidly. Because of this, publication of research in a timely manner is
especially critical. The journal literature is one way to share research
information in computer engineering, but conference papers are more
important. The structure of a conference paper is frequently very similar
to a journal article, but these papers report on recently completed or in
progress research, so they represent the cutting edge of the field.

Another important source of research information is the technical report.
For years, computer scientists have shared their research results with one
another via technical reports. Technical reports may report on research, or
they may report on the results of investigations or design projects. Many
computer science research groups have put their technical reports online to
allow open access to their results. US Government sponsored technical
reports may be available online or at a research library. The Mason
Department of Computer Science has their own technical report archive at
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~tr-admin/">http://cs.gmu.edu/~tr-admin/</a>.
The reports in this archive cover over twenty years of research.

Scholarly journal and conference articles in computer science are important
to researchers. The publication of research journals and conference
proceedings in computer science has been controlled by professional
societies and several independent publishers.  Societies publishing
journals related computer science and IT include IEEE and ACM. The
publisher Springer has long published computer science related research,
most notably the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science. This series
covers many different aspects of computer science and provides access to
the papers from many international conferences.

The peer review process for journals is usually a double blind process in
which neither the author nor the reviewer know the otherâ€™s identity. Peer
review by an expert in the field helps establish the reliability of the
information contained within a research paper. Scholarly computer science
journals may be peer reviewed.
</p>

<p>
Conference papers may also be peer reviewed but may not receive as rigorous
a review as a journal paper receives. The review of technical reports is
generally not a blind peer review process. Instead, subject matter experts
in the same or another organization may review the technical report and
comment on it before its release to the public.

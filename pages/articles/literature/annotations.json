The stance, claim, or question frames the main ideas around which the article is organized, but there may at times be tangents or sub-arguments which are merely related to the main claims.  Sometimes, claims may be implicit in an article or will be spread across several paragraphs. In these cases, it is often helpful to try to summarize the argument rather than locating a place where the author explicitly states a claim."

    "string": "Sweet is primarily looks at colonialist theories as evidenced in promotional literature for colonial ventures in the New World and More’s Utopia, exploring how they drew on both economic and ecological ideas (i.e. the role of the environment of the New World in English economic development). More specifically, Sweet argues that many of these colonialist theories came under “steady-state or sustainable economic theory” . Sweet’s main argument is that this steady-state theory drew on both economic and ecological ideas, but that later colonialist discourse shifted toward a more purely economic vein. Sweet suggests that the more holistic sixteenth and seventeenth colonialist discourse could be a model for- or approach to- reintegrating ecology into economic discourse. Sweet’s work can be placed more broadly within “ecocriticism,” a school of criticism that investigates the relationships between  literature and other related subject areas and the environment. To learn more about “ecocriticism,” <a href=\"http://litguide.press.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/view.cgi?eid=84\">look at the entry in the Johns Hopkins 400, third partial paragraph</a>."

Sweet uses evidence of historical usage from the Oxford English Dictionary to argue a given interpretation that serves his larger arguments. <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/226027?rskey=uQ3CTi&result=1#eid\">You can use the Oxford English Dictionary to explore this term</a>.

Many literary studies articles have conclusions are at least a few pages long, depending on the overall length of the article. Sweet takes his specific arguments on English colonial promotional literature and expands them, explaining how they might be applied to other literature in the time period, the larger discourse of ecocriticism itself, and finally, to a more contemporary example, West Virginia mountaintop removal mining. This general structure of Sweet’s argument is not unusual for literary criticism: he moves from the general to the specific in his introduction, then develops textual arguments based on specific texts in the body of his article, and then moves from the specific back to the more general in his conclusion."

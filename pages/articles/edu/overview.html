Research by educators is communicated via peer-reviewed journal articles,
trade publications, and books. The purpose of education research is to
examine how learning takes place, the effectiveness of education policies
at national, state and sometimes local levels, to investigate change and
new developments in the field of education, analysis of educational
interventions, and teaching methodologies as well as teacher training
practices. Research in education literally spans the entire life span.
Education researchers often specialize in a certain aspect of education
and/or specific groups including traditional and nontraditional students.

The actual research is conducted in a variety of ways including systematic
literature reviews which examine commonalities and differences in current
education literature. It may entail gathering data via observations,
interviews, and the gathering of empirical data. These types of research
have one thing in common; they attempt to solve a problem. The research
itself may be conducted by professors, graduate or doctoral students at
academic institutions such as Mason. This type of research involves the
design of research studies which test educational theories and
methodologies. Often the research is conducted in an attempt to find
solutions to problems in specific education settings. Research of this type
is often conducted by organizations or institutions outside of that
educational setting. Generally the agency contracting the research has a
vested interest in the results of the research and expects recommendations
which may help to solve their problem.

The methods used to conduct the educational research include qualitative,
quantitative, and mixed methods. Quantitative research includes case
studies, narratives, historical research, journals, diaries, etc.
Qualitative research includes gathering of numerical data including that
found in single and multi-subject research, meta-analysis, and
correlational research. Mixed methods research combines different research
methods including action research and program evaluation. The ultimate goal
is to solve problems experienced by teachers in the classroom.

For those researchers who wish to publish their results they must find a
journal related to their topic.  Some journals are sponsored by
professional organizations such as the American Educational Research
Association (AERA), the National Academy of Education (NAEd), and the
National Council of Teachers of English. Journal submission guidelines
include specific instructions for length of articles, the review process
including how the article reviews are conducted, the style used to write
the articles. For education the 6<sup>th</sup> is most often used. The
peer-review process may take several months and it could take a year for
the article to be published. Researchers should also consider journal
acceptance rates which is the number of articles actually published from
those submitted in a given time period. Some believe that the lower the
acceptance rate the more prestigious the journal.

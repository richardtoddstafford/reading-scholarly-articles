<h3>How are new findings communicated in the Computer Science and IT disciplines?</h3>
<p>Computer Science and IT are relatively young disciplines that evolve rapidly. Because of this, publication of research in a timely manner is especially critical. The journal literature is one way to share research information in computer engineering, but conference papers are more important. The structure of a conference paper is frequently very similar to a journal article, but these papers report on recently completed or in progress research, so they represent the cutting edge of the field.</p>

Another important source of research information is the technical report. For years, computer scientists have shared their research results with one another via technical reports. Technical reports may report on research, or they may report on the results of investigations or design projects. Many computer science research groups have put their technical reports online to allow open access to their results. US Government sponsored technical reports may be available online or at a research library. The Mason Department of Computer Science has their own technical report archive at this URL: http://cs.gmu.edu/~tr-admin/ . The reports in this archive cover over twenty years of research.

<h3>What role do professional societies and publishers play in the dissemination of new findings in the Computer Science and IT disciplines?</h3>
<p>Scholarly journal and conference articles in computer science are important to researchers. The publication of research journals and conference proceedings in computer science has been controlled by professional societies and several independent publishers. Societies publishing journals related computer science and IT include IEEE and ACM. The publisher Springer has long published computer science related research, most notably the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science. This series covers many different aspects of computer science and provides access to the papers from many international conferences.</p>

<h3>What role does peer review play in the disciplines of Computer Science and IT?</h3>
<p>The peer review process for journals is usually a double blind process in which neither the author nor the reviewer know the otherâ€™s identity. Peer review by an expert in the field helps establish the reliability of the information contained within a research paper. Scholarly computer science journals may be peer reviewed.</p>

<p>Conference papers may also be peer reviewed but may not receive as rigorous a review as a journal paper receives. The review of technical reports is generally not a blind peer review process. Instead, subject matter experts in the same or another organization may review the technical report and comment on it before its release to the public.</p>

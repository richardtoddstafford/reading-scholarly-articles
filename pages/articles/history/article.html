Benjamin Crowninshield was dreaming about his youth.  ‘‘I dream about home,
about India, & indeed about any thing but Washington,’’ he wrote his wife
from the national capital in November 1816. Appointed Madison’s Secretary
of the Navy two years before, Crowninshield found himself longing for his
days as a young merchant-mariner in the Indian Ocean. To the desk-bound
former captain, the East Indies remained a fresh and exotic world where
skillful young men could hone their honor and engineer their fortunes. In
his travels, he had found that the genteel native population of India had
included rational, like-minded individuals with whom American merchants
could deal with on a more or less equal footing. Crowninshield had even
gone so far as to once give a speech against the sending of American
missionaries to India. As a member of the Massachusetts State House of
Representatives, he had vehemently argued against extending a charter to
the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1812. Drawing
on his lengthy experiences in Indian ports where he ‘‘had become acquainted
with the amiable manners of that mild, much misrepresented people,’’
Crowninshield had proclaimed from his seat that Indians were ‘‘perfectly
satisfied with their own religion, + wanted no change.’’ Striking a
surprisingly modern pose of intercultural respect, Crowninshield had found
that ‘‘the manners, the address + the learning of the principal men among
the Hindoos’’ was comparable to ‘‘those who it was contemplated to send out
to instruct them.’’ What was more, ‘‘there were those among them who had
examined our religion + were familiar with its doctrines.’’<sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>
Crowninshield may have been one of the more tolerant men of his generation,
but he was not alone; many other American merchants who made landfall in
exotic locales in the first twenty years of independence managed to
disentangle themselves from prejudice, at least enough to do business. This
was especially the case in South Asia, where the officers of American
merchantmen dealt extensively with upper class native Indians. Desirous
of enjoying financial success, American sea officers arrived at Indian
ports with a willingness to set aside cultural, religious, and racial
differences. While not all American merchants readily relinquished their
suspicions when dealing with native Indians, all of them needed to build up
a personal rapport with Indian businessmen in order to be successful.
Although these relationships ranged from friendly and respectful to
condescending and patronizing, all were constructed out of varying degrees
of trust, familiarity, and cultural sensitivity. (See Figure 1.)

The golden age of the American India trade lasted only a few decades; after
the War of 1812, a shifting domestic economy and new legislation jettisoned
all but the most persistent merchants from the business entirely. In the
1810s, America’s predominant vision of India and its denizens began to
change as missionaries gradually came to replace merchants as the dominant
American travelers to India in the early republic.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Their characterization of Indian civilization as dark, diabolic, and
barbaric differed dramatically from those of their mercantile predecessors.
By casting themselves as the spiritual saviors for pagan Indians in a pro-
lific missionary press, American evangelicals forged a new, supercilious
paradigm of the non-Christian world for antebellum Americans.<sup>3</sup>

<p class="inline" id="researchmethod" rel="annotation">
The few historians who have followed Americans venturing into British
India have missed this crucial transformation. Most of these have dwelt on
either merchant-mariners or missionaries, but not both. G.  Bhagat, in his
pioneering work, Americans in India: 1784–1860, combined both commercial
and cultural analysis. Yet by focusing mainly on sea captains, Bhagat also
explicitly left missionaries out of the story, finding that a ‘‘discussion
of these contacts would require a separate volume.’’ Susan S. Bean carried
Bhagat’s work further, arguing in her work Yankee India: American
Commercial and Cultural Encounters with India in the Age of Sail,
1784–1860, that merchant-mariners abroad in the subcontinent formed their
own, uniquely American vision of India, one that reflected American values
as well as Indian realities.
</p>
<p class="noindent inline" id="litreview" rel="annotation">
While Bean acknowledged that the ‘‘experiences of East India merchants
instilled a more complex, sometimes more liberal view of Hinduism’’ than
those of missionaries, she engages almost solely with the perspectives of
gentlemen merchants, largely leaving out the perspectives of missionaries
who rewrote America’s relationship with the Indian world. Likewise,
monographs that address American missionaries in India during the early
republic pay little attention to the mariners who made their subjects’
missions possible. While the study of Indo–American relations in the era of
the early republic may be heading into a revival, a holistic view of
American relations with India—one that can keep in perspective all the
disparate parts of that historically rich interaction—remains elusive. By
glossing over the contrast in perspective between merchants and
missionaries, historians have fallen short of an important shift in how
Americans perceived themselves, the world, and their place in global
affairs.  <sup>4</sup>
</p>

<p>
Whether as merchant-mariners or missionaries, Americans wrote of their
interactions with South Asian peoples and cultures for different reasons.
American merchants may have had a professional interest in mustering
written evidence of friendly relations with South Asian partners. This
was largely because sea officers’ present and future employers might
scrutinize their ships’ journals or logbooks when weighing hiring decisions
and vessel destinations. Such scrutiny may have guided merchant-mariners to
treat their logs and journals as de facto re ́sume ́s as well as reports
encouraging the next investor. Missionaries, by contrast, understood the
power of the press, and they wrote home missives intended for public
consumption. Missionary societies routinely published these letters to
satisfy the interest of wealthy benefactors, to recruit new donors, and to
advertise both their accomplishments and the necessity of their
activities. By highlighting the ignorance and suffering of South Asians in
their publications, Christian proselytizers hoped to advance their faith
both abroad and at home by stirring readers to partake in their cause.
While American commercial and evangelical writings about native India were
guided by occupational pressures, both remain useful as the products of
very different professional lenses. <sup>5</sup>

<hr>

<p>
Before the American Revolution, the monopoly of the British East India
Company (BEIC) excluded private American merchants from trading with Asia.
Yet while individual American colonists rarely visited the subcontinent,
India was quite active in their imaginations. Throughout the eighteenth
century, the Anglo–American press churned out rumors and reports on the
military tumult in India as Persians, Afghanis, South Asians, and Europeans
jostled to take advantage of the decay in Mughal power. Britain’s chronic
warfare with eighteenth-century France, moreover, spilled over into
India. Popular colonial newspapers closely followed the martial exploits
of men like Sir Robert Clive against native potentates and the French in
India in the middle of the century, as well as the moral controversies that
seemed to haunt the BEIC as it grew in influence, treasure, and power. As
the crisis of the British North American colonies came to a boil, Thomas
Paine took a keen interest in Indian affairs and may have turned to radical
politics in part because he saw the BEIC’s abuse of native peoples as an
ominous prelude to what Parliament would do elsewhere in the empire.
<sup>6</sup>
</p>

<p>
After the American Revolution, American publishers and newspaper editors
continued to satiate their readers’ taste for events in South Asia.
Capitalizing on the popularity of travel literature, American newspapers
and magazines printed accounts of foreign travel. Metropolitan and pri-
vate libraries stacked their shelves with tomes of world tours, foreign
captivities, martial contests, and ocean voyages. Upwardly mobile young
men, who hoped to pass for gentlemen partly by being knowledgeable of
worldly affairs, especially prized travel accounts. In major American ports
along the Atlantic, blue-water merchants like Benjamin Crowninshield had
a practical impetus to peruse them. Whatever they could not extract from
colleagues and ships’ journals housed at various New England marine
societies, merchants could get from books. Indeed, publishers churned out
titles such as The Merchants Unerring Guide to the East India and China
Trade, published in Philadelphia in 1807, to answer merchants’ desires for
pragmatic knowledge. <sup>7</sup>
</p>

<p>
Americans at the turn of the nineteenth century perceived the Indian
subcontinent as one feature in a vast oceanic terrain they termed the
‘‘East Indies,’’ a rough region that included any port past the Cape of
Good Hope. Often times, an American commercial voyage to India would
include stops in South Africa, Indonesia, and Canton. For Americans, as
historian James Fitcher writes, ‘‘however far Calcutta and Canton were
from each other they seemed still infinitely closer to each other than to
home.’’ Thus, they conceived of India and the subcontinent’s East Indian
satellites as parts of a natural whole stitched together by empires,
religion, language, and trade. Most importantly, Americans also saw the
region as an exotic realm where the fortunes of English-speaking peoples
could be won or lost. <sup>8</sup>
</p>

<p>
The merchant officers who would do business in Indian ports came from
varied backgrounds. While they were often upper or middle-class young men,
some had risen up through the ranks over years of service at sea. Salem, in
particular, was privy to a long tradition of forecastle lads who eventually
attained the position of shipmasters and officers. Yet while
nineteenth-century sailors liked to say that the best seamen ‘‘should enter
on board through the hawse-holes (or forecastle), and not by the cabin
windows,’’ many of the officers of American East Indiamen entered the
profession by the latter. Many were also well educated. Two future India
traders, for example, Henry Lee and William Augustus Rogers, studied at
private boarding schools. After graduation, well-connected fathers might
find employment for their sons at the customs and counting houses,
shipyards, and law firms of the booming maritime-trade towns of New
England.</p>
<p class="noindent inline" id="primaryevidence" rel="annotation">
The future India trader Dudley Leavitt Pickman, for instance, started his
salty career through the patronage of his father, who took him to work with
him at the Salem Custom House.  R. J. Cleveland, for his part, entered the
profession at the age of fourteen, when he had signed on as an apprentice
in the counting house of a Salem merchant. <sup>9</sup>
</p>

<p>
Regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds, America’s first India
traders dreamt of building personal fortunes through trade with the East.
In doing so, they would also prove their own masculine competence and
business acumen. In 1843, one old retired seaman described New England men
as being ‘‘obliged to seek their own fortunes,’’ possessed of ‘‘industrious
and frugal habits,’’ and seeking ‘‘that independence of which all are more
or less desirous.’’ Some ambitious American men sought the honor of fame as
well as of fortune. In November of 1795, Jacob Crowninshield wrote to his
brothers George and John from Calcutta that he had loaded ‘‘a fine young
Elephant 3 years old’’ into the hold of his ship. ‘‘I dare say we shall get
him home safe,’’ he declared to his brothers, estimating that ‘‘he’ll bring
at 5000 dollars’’ in the States.  ‘‘I suppose you both laugh at the
Scheme,’’ Crowninshield ventured, ‘‘but I do not mind that . . . if it
succeeds I ought to have the whole Credit, Ⳮ the honor too, of course, for
you know ‘twill be a great thing to carry the first Elephant to America.’’
Literate, tending toward cultural cosmopolitanism, and aspiring to fortune
if not fame—these were the qualities of the men who would write the first
chapters of national America’s encounter with the Indian world.
<sup>10</sup>
</p>

<p>
The Treaty of Paris cut Yankee merchants free from restrictions on trade
with Asia. With the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars waging in
Europe and across the world in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, risk-taking American merchants prospered by negotiating the
booms and busts of neutral trade. Their commercial success was also aided
by the nearly unregulated nature of American maritime commerce, which
allowed United States citizens to take advantage of global opportunities
that European merchants could not. Elias Hasket Derby, Jr., for example,
became the first millionaire in the United States by exploiting the demand
for neutral traders to carry goods between British India, the Danish colony
of Tranquebar, the French Mauritius, the Malabar Coast, and Indonesia.
<sup>11</sup>
</p>

<p>
The first American merchantman reached India in the last month of 1784.
Bound out from Philadelphia, The United States bypassed British Madras to
trade at French Pondicherry. Other American merchantmen followed in the
wake of the United States, but these vessels favored Anglo–Indian ports.
The BEIC, however, vacillated when trying to decide whether or not to let
Americans have a piece of the Indian pie.  Instinctively protective of its
monopoly, the BEIC also distrusted the permanency of American neutrality in
the face of European wars, and they were unsettled by the United States’
inability to deal with North African corsairs. ‘‘So suspicious are they
here now of Americans,’’ the first American consul for Calcutta, Benjamin
Joy, explained to some business partners in Bombay in 1794, ‘‘that a person
must be known before they will ship with him, or have some one here that
will be answerable for him.’’ <sup>12</sup>
</p>

<p>
Yet the British could also be welcoming to American traders in India;
Americans offered to open up new markets for Indian goods and they also
largely traded in silver, a resource that the BEIC desperately needed.
Anglo–Indian sentiment appeared to be pro-American; as Bhagat writes,
‘‘Praise for America in general [amongst the British residents of Calcutta]
was very high.’’ Indeed, official British policy toward American traders in
India was so conflicted that American merchants paid the same tariff rate
as British subjects. Lord Cornwallis, who acceded to the post of
Governor-General of India in 1786 after his surrender at Yorktown, pro-
claimed that ‘‘the vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States
of America, shall be admitted and hospitably received, in all the sea ports
and harbors of the British territories in the East Indies.’’ Even Jay’s
Treaty in 1794, which ostensibly closed the lucrative carrying trade in the
British East Indies to American bottoms, also legalized American commerce
in the British East Indies and promised that American shipmasters would
pay no more duties than British ones.</p>
<p class="noindent inline" rel="annotation" id="secondaryevidence">
In the early years of Indo–American commerce, moreover, some BEIC merchants
took advantage of Yankee ships to send home property and to avoid the
scrutiny of their employers.  <sup>13</sup>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the relationships between American and British merchants in
India tended toward competition and isolation. The official stance of the
BEIC was to treat with its own merchants first, and private British
merchants were furious that Americans could have access to markets that
they could not. Anglo–American diplomacy in India faltered, moreover, with
the brief consulate of Benjamin Joy. A Newburyport merchant, Joy had
served as the first American consul in Calcutta from 1792–1796, though he
was never officially recognized as such by British authorities. Joy,
frustrated by the ‘‘jealousy here, among the British merchants in this
Country of the using Commerce of the Americans in this quarter of the
world’’ (and also perhaps feigning illness), asked to be relieved of duty
in the winter of 1796. With no official American presence on shore,
American merchants in Indian ports tended to fraternize amongst themselves.
When the Fourth of July rolled around in 1807, for example, the American
merchantman Restitution was resting at anchor in Calcutta’s Hugli River.
Its captain, David Dunn Pulsifer, recorded that while Fort William fired a
salute ‘‘to Honour the Day,’’ the ‘‘Captains of American ships dined
together at one house while the Mattes [were] all on board the Ship James
of Salem.’’ <sup>14</sup>
</p>

<p>
Limited commercial relations with the BEIC afforded Americans a unique
opportunity to forge business ties with the native community.  American
merchants in Anglo–Indian metropolises daily interacted with indigenous
peoples. Many would rent houses in the city while their ships were in port,
hiring native servants to help with household chores. On the city’s
maritime edge, they were also obliged to rent a godown, or warehouse. A
contract with an Indian merchant would bring sircars, or clerks, as well as
regiments of ‘‘coolies,’’ strong backs accustomed to the rigors of
stevedore labor. When their sailors fell ill, American captains sometimes
replaced them with lascars, South Asian seamen frequently used in the Royal
Navy. On August 5, 1793, for example, a native Bengali named G. Manuel
joined the crew of Benjamin Carpenter’s ship Hercules. This sort of
employment was rare, however; more common was the use of the lascar for
loading purposes while in port. In the spring of 1833, for instance, James
B. Briggs, master of the Salem merchantman Apthorp, recorded in the ship’s
journal that ‘‘11 lascars and one serang came on board to assist
discharging ballast.’’ By day, American merchants would journey to the
bazaars. There, they would spend hours examining prices and cloths and
breathing the hot, dusty, spice-laden air of the open market where the
voices of Armenian, Muslim, Hindu, Portuguese, Persian, and British vendors
haggled and bargained. <sup>15</sup>
</p>

<p>
Most important, however, was the native merchant with whom an American
supercargo or sea captain did business. These men were called banians in
Calcutta and dubashes in Madras, and a few of them made the American trade
their specialty. Dubashes and banians were often descended from the ranks
of the Kayasthas, or scribes, in the Hindu caste system. Historian Kenneth
W. Porter described them as members ‘‘of a Hindu caste of traders and
merchants who frequently acted as bankers and brokers in foreign
commerce.’’ <sup>16</sup>
</p>

<p>
Wealthy Kayasthas were well equipped to suit the needs of Western
merchants; their education, linguistic skills, penmanship, and exactitude
were easily reapplied for successful careers as businessmen in Anglo–
Indian metropolises. Many even adopted some Western ways; as R. J.
Cleveland commented, ‘‘the native merchants [in Calcutta] possess large
fortunes, and some of them have apartments fitted up in the European
style.’’ The station and upbringing of these men made it easier for Boston
and Salem sea officers to drop negative preconceptions and to form close
commercial relationships with their foreign partners. While some niggardly
American merchants looked upon their Indian partners with suspicion and
addressed them with condescension, many Americans managed to sequester
their prejudices and form respectful and lucrative relationships (and
sometimes friendships) with the native Indian merchants with whom they
dealt. <sup>17</sup>
</p>

<p>
The confluence of American sea captains and Indian indigenous elites was a
business necessity; as Jacob Crowninshield, the older brother of Benjamin
and Richard, explained to Secretary of State James Madison in 1806 in a
report on Indo–American commerce, ‘‘[We] buy our cargoes of the native
merchants and not of the English residents because they come to us at a
lower price through this channel.’’ Likewise, in 1804 Dudley Leavitt
Pickman confessed that his countrymen ‘‘have very little to do with the
English at Calcutta.’’ Rather, ‘‘they employ native banians, as brokers or
agents, and through them make all their purchases.’’ <sup>18</sup>
</p>

<p>
American merchants turned to banians because they offered essential
economic services. ‘‘He signed the customhouse bonds,’’ historian Kenneth
Porter writes of them, ‘‘and apparently guaranteed payment for goods
purchased through him.’’ Salem merchant Benjamin Carpenter advised the
readers of his journal in 1790 to procure a dubash upon their arrival at
Madras, as he was ‘‘useful when you are at a loss for a market and will
frequently dispose of your articles, when you have made every effort
without success.’’ Bean similarly stresses the importance of native
merchants in the American India trade: ‘‘The banian was essential,’’ she
writes: ‘‘he spoke English; he knew the market; he knew where to procure
commodities and sell imports; and sometimes he supplied capital as well. .
. . Such dependency,’’ she continues, ‘‘nurtured trust when the
transactions were successful and suspicion when they failed. The success
often led to relationships that transcended pure commerce.’’ <sup>19</sup>
</p>

<p>
American merchants tended to see India and the East Indies as stepping
stones to wealth, honor, and comfort. That perspective likely influenced
their perceptions of the country and their indigenous business partners.
Some Indo–American mercantile relationships would even verge on friendship.
One Salem businessman, George Nichols, for example, fell into business
relations with a native merchant named Nusserwanjee Maneckjee Wadia when
he anchored outside Bombay in 1800 (see Figure 2). When Wadia learned that
Nichols was engaged to a young woman in Salem, he procured an Indian muslin
dress for the wedding, and sold it to him for five dollars per yard.
Sometime later, Nusserwanjee gave Nichols a ‘‘camel’s hair shawl’’ to
accompany it. In exchange, Nichols offered Wadia a treasured book from
his ship’s library, William Mavor’s Voyages and Travels, a historical
survey of notable explorers. <sup>20</sup>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, across the subcontinent in Calcutta, another form of gift giving
had evolved. There, banians were accustomed to commissioning self-portraits
as presents for their American counterparts. Americans reciprocated the
favor; in 1801, for example, several American merchants joined together to
present an oil-on-canvas-portrait of President George Washington to
Ramdulal Dey, a prosperous banian who specialized in the city’s American
trade. In true appropriateness to the occasion, Washington has his arm
extended in a gesture of generosity. Today, numerous portraits of Indian
merchants grace the collections of the Peabody–Essex Museum in Salem,
Massachusetts, each representing a personal memory of America’s forgotten
India trade. <sup>21</sup>

</p>


<hr>

<p>
When Richard Crowninshield of Salem arrived in Calcutta in the early spring
of 1796, he was met by a banian named Ramsoonder Mitter.  Mitter handed him
a letter of introduction and recommendation from a friend of
Crowninshield’s, J. Hodges. In it, Hodges called Mitter ‘‘one of the best
Banyans in Calcutta.’’ While observing that ‘‘it is customary for them
[banians] all to apply for recom. ens when there Masters leave them,’’
Hodges promised that ‘‘what I have sed of this Banyan is from the purest
motives of friendship.’’ <sup>22</sup>
</p>

<p>
As Hodges’s use of the term ‘‘master’’ in his letter reveals, the Indo–
American commercial relationship was complex. Many parsimonious Yankees,
jealous of their future fortunes, were suspicious of their Indian partners.
‘‘American merchants,’’ Porter has described, ‘‘regarded the banian as of
low commercial morality.’’ When Benjamin Carpenter noted the necessity of
working with dubashes in Madras, he also urged his readers to be cautious:
Indians, he noted, were a sort of ‘‘artful men and require well looking
after.’’ Likewise, one contemporary American treatise on Asian trade
warned its readers to beware the ‘‘cunning of the natives’’ lest they
‘‘inevitably become their dupe.’’ Dudley Leavitt Pickman, who first
sailed to India as a supercargo in 1799, found members of the Brahmin caste
to be the most dependable. ‘‘But even these are not worthy of implicit
confidence,’’ he wrote, observing that ‘‘even among the richest and most
respectable of the natives . . . very few are seen in whose honor and
integrity great confidence can be placed.’’ ‘‘Almost every native,’’
Pickman concluded later, ‘‘may be considered a beggar.’’ <sup>23</sup>
</p>

<p>
The correspondence of Henry Lee reveals some of the complexities of the
relationships forged between American and Indian merchants. A lifelong
India trader, Lee was not afraid to use both the carrot and the stick to
get favorable results from his banians. In 1807, anxiously awaiting word
from a Calcuttan associate, Lee scribbled a letter from Boston that closed
with a hint of a threat: ‘‘We shall continue to speak well of you,’’ he
wrote, ‘‘& hope you will continue to deserve the good Character you now
sustain.’’ Nine years later, Lee wrote to two banians, Goluck Chunder Day
and Ramdon Bonarjia, promising them that they would all rise together if
they performed well. ‘‘You know very well what I have done for others,’’
Lee’s missive ended, ‘‘& that it is in my power to serve you also, if you
are worthy of it.’’ Yet he also signed this same letter as ‘‘Your friend &
Sev t .’’ An astute judge of character, Lee gave credit where it was due.
In 1812, he wrote to his fellow India trader Andrew Cabot, addressing his
dealings with two banians, Tillock and Ramdon: ‘‘I think them much more
capable in their business than any of the others,’’ he reported, ‘‘& they
have every motive that can operate upon men desirous of establishing a
reputation & acquiring wealth.’’ Scrupulous and constant, condescending and
rewarding, at times master, friend, and servant, Henry Lee knew how to
navigate men as well as markets in colonial Calcutta. <sup>24</sup>
</p>

<p>
A small dose of suspicion may have been natural and even appropriate for
the kinds of long-term business relationships that formed between Indian
banians and New England merchants. To be successful, both parties had to
exercise discretion and be good judges of character. They also had to
nurture a mutual trust, each knowing that the other offered services that
they could not effect alone. Banians sought to make a good impression so as
to win the recommendations required to attract a new American partner.
Threatening a banian with a bad rap, then, was one of the more powerful
means that an American could get what he wanted.  At the same time, Indian
merchants could simply elope with a Yankee’s investment, spoiling an
American’s voyage and damaging his career.
</p>

<p>
What is less clear is the role that race played in early Indo–American
commercial relations. Europeans in India had divided many of their coastal
cities into ‘‘white towns,’’ comprising company agents and support staff,
and ‘‘black towns,’’ consisting of native Indians, Portuguese Catholics,
and Armenians. The surgeon of the United States, for instance, Thomas
Redman, wrote of the segregation that divided blacks from whites in
Pondicherry in 1784. ‘‘The white Town is separated from the black by a
Canal,’’ he recorded, ‘‘which extends along the back of it, with Bridges
thrown over every Street to keep up the Communication.’’ By mid-day, Redman
noticed that the heat kept all whites indoors but for those in palanquins,
‘‘which are carried by the black boys on their Shoulders.’’ ‘‘The B[l]acks
here,’’ Redman concluded, ‘‘are in the most abject State of Slavery, &
Bondage to the Europeans.’’ <sup>25</sup>
</p>

<p>
Redman was one of the first American citizens to see India. Later observers
in the mercantile period were not as pithy on the subject of race as he
was. Skin color was not likely meaningless to American merchant-mariners,
and it may have added to the sense of difference and suspicion within
partnerships. Many Americans also expressed bewilderment at the racially
tinged Hindu caste system. ‘‘Amongst themselves [Indians] are arbitrary and
tyrannical, one to the other,’’ Redman wrote in the ship’s journal.
Similarly, when trading in Madras in 1799, Dudley Leavitt Pickman was
surprised when his high-caste native guide ‘‘refused to ask information,
even as interpreter,’’ from a lower caste member. A rough brand of racism
may have allowed some India traders, including Henry Lee of Boston, to
assume patronizing airs when dealing with his banians. Even so, race seems
to have been a category that was also easily transcended when American ship
officers interacted with their wealthy business partners: Profits were
simply too important to let pigmentation get in the way. <sup>26</sup>
</p>

<p>
While not all Americans could entirely divorce themselves from the
assumptions of their societies, many also demonstrated a surprising abil-
ity to abandon prejudice in the pursuit of profit across the East Indies.
Few American merchant families possessed more of that cultural tact than
the Crowninshields of Salem, Massachusetts. In 1790, George Crowninshield
joined with his five sons in forming the merchant firm George Crowninshield
and Sons. They may have owed the inspiration, at least in part, to the
success of their cousin. His name was Benjamin Crowninshield, and he was a
generation older than the future Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Williams
Crowninshield. Born in 1758, Crowninshield had risen through the ranks of
Salem’s merchant-mariners, such that by December of 1788, he had won
command of the brig Henry as an employee of the Derby family. Skirting
South Africa, dabbling in the ports of Iˆle de France, Madras, and
Calcutta, Crowninshield returned to Salem in the last month of 1790 having
helped win his employers a windfall profit of $100,000. <sup>27</sup>
</p>

<p>
The people of India had made a deep impression on Crowninshield.  One
Calcutta scene in particular occupied a chunk of the log of the Henry: In
November of 1789, he had witnessed a sati, the ritual burning of a widow
alongside a deceased husband. Indians understood the sati tradition as an
act of ideal love with ancient roots, though the British would later use it
to justify their civilizing mission in India. Having received word ‘‘of the
barbarous operation to be performed,’’ Crowninshield, Elias Hasket Derby,
Jr., and ‘‘two Irish gentlemen’’ set out to witness the event. The widow
was deferential to the white newcomers, paying ‘‘her obeisance to us then
order[ing] her two little sons to step forward and do the same.’’ When the
fire was stacked and the husband’s corpse properly positioned, the widow
lay beside and embraced him. A party of ‘‘four men stood by with green
bamboo rods to hold her down in case she should not be able to stand the
flames.’’ The couple’s sons set the wood afire. Through the heat and smoke
Crowninshield could make out the figure of the widow, encased in flames and
lying on her back. ‘‘I did not think it was in the power of a human person
to meet death in such a manner,’’ he penned. While calling it ‘‘a most
horrid sight,’’ the young captain also acknowledged that the ritual
‘‘appeared very solemn to me.’’ ‘‘Whether it is right or wrong,’’ he mused,
‘‘I leave it for other people to determine.’’ <sup>28</sup>
</p>

<p>
Not all American merchants reacted with as much open-mindedness to Indian
cultures as Crowninshield; many others found native rites to be troubling
and perturbing. When Captain David Dunn Pulsifer arrived in Calcutta in
1807, for example, he was sufficiently repulsed by one Hindu tradition that
he recorded it in his log. ‘‘It is not uncommon,’’ he wrote, ‘‘to see Dead
Bodys Go past Every Day, More of Less,’’ referring to the corpses that he
saw bobbing in the waters about his vessel. Pulsifer may have known that
rivers formed sacred depositions for the dead in Hindu tradition, but
nevertheless he began to record the number of cadavers that floated past
almost as carefully as he did bags of sugar carried below deck. ‘‘4 Dead
Body’s Went By to Day,’’ he wrote on August 9. Similarly, during his visit
to India in the late 1790s, Major Shaw regurgitated British stories of
Indian religious austerities in his journal. One of them described a Hindu
man who had crawled on his belly by the banks of the Ganges from source to
sea and another recounted a devotee who had pledged to keep his hands
together and ‘‘suffer[ed] the nails of each to penetrate the back of the
other, and in that manner river them inseparably.’’ Shaw also related his
impression of the Hindu ritual of ‘‘hooking,’’ in which ‘‘a large hook’’
would be forced through the fleshy parts of the devotee’s back,’’ and who
is subsequently lifted into the air ‘‘amidst the acclamations of his
countrymen.’’ After watching four men undergo the process, Shaw concluded
that Hindus ‘‘place the point of honor in the firmness with which they will
bear pain.’’ Pickman witnessed the same ritual in Calcutta when he visited
the city as supercargo of the Derby in 1803. ‘‘It is surprising,’’ he
wrote, ‘‘that among a people whose religion and manners are so mild as the
Hindoos, such customs should exist.’’ (See Figure 3.) <sup>29</sup>
</p>

<p>
Even if they found some local customs repulsive, many American merchants
also managed to transcend cultural barriers. The Crowninshield brothers
especially benefited from their intercultural tact when dealing with
foreign societies. While on a voyage to Sumatra aboard the America III,
Benjamin William’s older brother John Crowninshield had characterized the
Sumatrans as ‘‘much more indolent than the natives of Bengall’’ (though
‘‘equally as harmless’’). Nevertheless, he also found them civilized enough
to do business. In the length of one conference with a band of Pegu chiefs,
Crowninshield explained that ‘‘the reason [we] had not traded largely with
them before’’ was due to ‘‘the bad character we had heard of them.’’ The
natives expressed surprise, and hoped that Crowninshield would not
perpetuate that perspective when he returned home. After all, ‘‘between
nations thinking so different as we do there always must be great
misunderstanding,’’ they explained, also citing the language barrier that
separated Sumatrans from Americans. Crowninshield assured his trading
partners that he ‘‘thought very favourable indeed of them,’’ and
acknowledged that ‘‘our manners & customs were quite different.’’
Crowninshield then clarified to them that he was a very different breed of
American: ‘‘but then I was used to [it] having been almost all over India &
that a traveling merchant after seeing a few different nations would soon
learn to accommodate himself to the customs of the people who he came to
trade amongst.’’ ‘‘I had no prejudice against any Nation or religion at
all,’’ he concluded, and promised to return to Sumatra to trade.

<p>
Diplomatic and domestic factors impacted the American India trade several
times: Jefferson’s Embargo of 1807–1809 froze the business entirely while
the British capture of the ˆ I le de France in the Mauritius in 1810 drew
the curtain on America’s lucrative, transcolonial trafficking with that
island. The next year, Great Britain decreed illegal all Indo– American
commercial traffic except for that which sailed directly between
Anglo–Indian and American ports. While the impact of this latter action is
dubious, the war of the following year drew the India trade to a
standstill. The War of 1812 particularly undermined American commerce with
India as New England merchants, landlocked by the British naval blockade,
began to invest in the nascent American textile industry. <sup>31</sup>

<p>
The war was barely over before America’s India traders had another reason
to find a different profession. In April of 1816, Congress passed a new
tariff law. The bill, slated to go into effect later that June, was
designed to promote domestic cloth manufactures by chasing foreign products
out of the market. It raised duties on foreign cloth, articles that had
previously formed the mainstay of a profitable Indian venture. In the end,
it was neither wars nor treaties alone that strangled the India trade in
the early republic, but the rise of the textile industry and Congress’s
enthusiasm to support it. <sup>32</sup>
</p>

<p>
Boston India traders like Henry Lee knew that the tariff increases were
game changers; as he wrote in 1817, ‘‘The trade to Calcutta is now almost
confined to Sugar & Cotton, and no longer affords those advantages to me
which it would have done had not the duties on Piece Goods been
increased.’’ Indo–American commerce would experience a partial revival in
the late 1830s with Frederick Tudor’s global ice business, but the 1816
legislation nearly killed it. Now, between Congressional regulation and
domestic industrialization, only veteran, knowledgeable, and determined
businessmen could afford to stay in the trade. <sup>33</sup>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
As merchants reeled from their government’s new economic policies, other
Americans found India more accessible than ever before. Beginning in the
1810s, American missionaries began to brave the seas to work in India.
Their stay depended on a change in domestic policy amongst the country’s
British rulers. BEIC administrators had long been wary of missionary work
amongst their nonwhite subjects, fearing that it might spark an uprising if
the conversionary pressure proved too oppressive.  Memories of the Black
Hole of Calcutta prompted BEIC officials to keep zealous missionaries at
arm’s length. <sup>34</sup>
</p>

<p>
The BEIC’s resistance to proselytizing in India did not prevent devout
English-speaking Christians from trying, however. At the turn of the
century, the religious revivalism of the Second Great Awakening was
sweeping through the Anglophonic world. While the American Revolution’s
emphasis on secular affairs seemed to suggest that religion had taken a
back seat to politics in the first decades of the early republic, in
reality American Christianity was undergoing a resurgence. ‘‘Religion was
not displaced by the politics of the Revolution,’’ one historian explains;
‘‘instead, like much of American life, it was radically transformed.’’
The old religious regions of colonial days gave way to new ones as the
Congregationalist, Baptist, Episcopal, and Methodist faiths expanded or
tried to hold their ground. ‘‘By 1815,’’ Gordon Wood writes, ‘‘America had
become the most evangelically Christian nation in the world.’’ In America
as in England, pious evangelicals became interested in establishing
missions in foreign lands. <sup>35</sup>
</p>

<p>
The first missionary to work in India and to achieve widespread fame was a
British Baptist named William Carey. Carey had the blessing and patronage
of the Governor-General of India, Richard Wellesley. He also enjoyed
substantial support from the United States, where the editors of
evangelical American periodicals reprinted his letters for their readers. A
few American congregations even supported Carey financially, raising some
$6,000 in 1806–1807, and $4,650 in 1810. In 1812, American Baptists founded
the Salem Bible Translation and Foreign Mission Society in Massachusetts
to help fund Carey’s translations in Serampore.  Prominent American
Baptists such as Thomas Baldwin kept regular correspondence with Carey
while he was in India. Likewise, in the first two decades of the nineteenth
century, the American press rolled off multiple editions of the work of
Claudius Buchanan, a Scottish Anglican who devoted his life to
Christianizing the Indian subcontinent. Even the library of the religious
liberal Thomas Jefferson included a copy of Buchanan’s Christian Researches
in Asia and Eras of Light. <sup>36</sup>
</p>

<p>
The efforts of British evangelicals ignited the imaginations of American
Christians. With British missionaries starting off for South Asian
villages, many American Christians sensed that ‘‘the greatest age in the
world’s history since the days of the apostles had arrived.’’ Inspired by
the example of men like Carey and Buchanan, Americans established the New
York Missionary Society in 1796, the Massachusetts Missionary Society in
1799, and the Massachusetts Baptist Missionary Society in 1802.
<sup>37</sup>
</p>

<p>
Most of the early American missionary societies focused on the alluring
prospect of converting Native American tribes and French Canadian
habitants. In 1810, however, a new organization arrived on the scene with a
more ambitious agenda: The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions (ABCFM), founded to propagate the Gospel in lands beyond the sea.
‘‘For the next half century,’’ as one historian notes, the ABCFM would
become ‘‘the largest organization devoted to sending benevolent workers
abroad.’’ With no American competitors, the ABCFM took the lead in
dispatching foreign missionaries. <sup>38</sup>
</p>

<p>
The destination of their first party was British India. Gordon Hall, Samuel
Nott, and Adoniram Judson (all graduates of Andover Divinity College),
together with Samuel Newell, James Richards, and Luther Rice, arrived in
Calcutta in 1812 expecting Providential support.  Instead, the BEIC threw
them out of the city on the suspicion of being American spies. The party
scattered. Hall and Nott proceeded to Bombay, where the local authorities
were more welcoming, while Newell and Richards relocated to Ceylon. Judson
and his wife had become Baptists while en route to India (as did Rice after
his arrival at Calcutta), and they joined some British Baptist missionaries
in Madras soon after their arrival. The following year, missionary fortunes
changed with Parliament’s Charter Act of 1813, which contained a clause
that cracked the door open to missions in India. As Nott would later
explain to a congregation in Connecticut in 1814, ‘‘Missionaries may now,
by the new charter of the BEIC go anywhere in their dominions, to
persuade sinners to be reconciled to God through the great Redeemer, and to
promote the morality of the gospel.’’ <sup>39</sup>
</p>

<p>
India was attractive to the ABCFM for several reasons. Firstly, the
expansion of the BEIC insured that missionaries would benefit from the
close proximity of a population that shared their language, customs, and
Christian faith. With the Company’s armed forces and its network of
alliances with local potentates, missionaries could hope for some physical
protection in the event of a native uprising.
</p>

<p>
Second, like the American India traders who preceded them, the Board was
relatively well read concerning India. Printed British sources, whether the
missives of William Carey, the sermons of Claudius Buchanan, or evangelical
books printed in the United States, emphasized Indians’ poor spiritual
health and their great need for Christianity. In 1811, for example, a pair
of printers in Philadelphia published The Baptist Mission in India.
Hoping that ‘‘an holy ardour may be excited and vigorous efforts employed
for the conversion of the heathen and the consequent diffusion of the great
Saviour’s empire,’’ the author pleaded with his American audience to take
part in missionary activities. ‘‘The moral state of the heathen calls aloud
for our piety, our labours, and our prayers,’’ they wrote, affirming that
the responsibility ‘‘to seek the spread of the gospel rest alike on all the
disciples of the Lord Jesus.’’ Finally, the teeming population of India (by
1800, the BEIC alone managed lands that contained twenty-four million
souls) also encouraged the Board to think of India as a realm where God
would need as many religious workers as He could get. <sup>40</sup>
</p>

<p>
While American missionaries witnessed the diversity of the Indian religious
scene through encounters with Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Armenian and
Portuguese Christians, and the Buddhists of Ceylon, they paid the most
attention to Hinduism. A product of thousands of years of regional
indigenous worship, Hinduism was (and remains) a diverse faith that
included hundreds of thousands of deities in its pantheon. As the largest
and the most visible faith in the subcontinent and with an emphasis on
divine form—especially though imagery, statue, or sculpture— Hinduism
seemed to precisely embody the ultimate pantheistic, sensual, and
idolatrous religion that American missionaries had set out to overthrow.
As one ABCFM missionary wrote from Calcutta, ‘‘No pen can describe the
deathlike influence of their senseless, stupid idolatries. It is no libel
upon them,’’ he continued, ‘‘to say that they have no morality.’’ (See
Figure 4.) Likewise, Mrs. Newell was horrified when she glimpsed the god
Jagannatha (which entered the English language as ‘‘Juggernaut’’) in
Calcutta in July of 1812. Out on a stroll of the city, Newell came across
the cart that had carried the god in a procession the month before. It was,
she wrote, ‘‘a huge building five stories high—images painted all over
it—two large horses with a charioteer made of wood in front—with many
wheels drawn by the natives with large cables.’’ After viewing the cart,
Newell went to the local temple, ‘‘where the great god of the Hindoos is
now residing—a horrid object indeed!’’ While she was not permitted to go
into the complex, she ‘‘could see him plainly—a log of wood painted red
with large hideous eyes.’’ <sup>41</sup>
</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4: Image of the goddess Durga, from William Ramsay’s Journal of a
Missionary Tour in India. American missionaries found many aspects of
Hinduism repulsive. William Ramsay, who served a term in the subcontinent
as an employee of the ABCFM, included this engraving of a statue of the
goddess Durga in his 1836 memoir. Ramsay thought that Hindu priests
attempted to make their ‘‘idols as horrid in appearance as possible, so as
to excite terror in the minds of the worshippers.’’
</p>


<p>
The first ABCFM missionaries set out for India with a common heartfelt
purpose: to convert to the only true faith scores of lost human beings who
would otherwise be hell-bound. For many contemporaries, it was a divinely
compassionate stance. For a people who literally believed in an eternal
hell of soul-consuming fire, evangelizing was more than an ordinary
humane action. Stationed on an island at Bombay, Nott wrote that it
‘‘contains 220,000 inhabitants,—all buried in gross ignorance and stu-
pidity: surely a number worthy of our exertions and prayers,’’ he penned,
‘‘if souls are truly valuable.’’ Missionaries also saw themselves as
replicating the devotion, love, and faith of earlier generations of
Christian martyrs and proselytizers. In 1818, the ABCFM missionary James
Richards wrote home in a state of broken health from Cape Town, South
Africa. In his epistle, he reflected on his experience as a missionary on
the island of Sri Lanka: ‘‘When the pious missionary arrives in a pagan
land,’’ he wrote, ‘‘and sees the people wholly given to idolatry, his
spirit is stirred within him; and, like Paul, he endeavors to bring them to
the knowledge of the truth.’’ <sup>42</sup>
</p>

<p>
To American Christians, proselytizing to non-Christian peoples was even
more heroic because missionaries had to cross into realms ruled by Lucifer
himself. ‘‘Almost everything which the missionary sees in a heathen
country,’’ James Richards noted, ‘‘is sadly calculated to draw away his
heart from God.’’ After witnessing a parade in honor of Jagannatha in
Calcutta in June of 1812, Mrs. Newell penned a letter to a friend in
Boston. Lamenting that more Americans were not engaged in missionary
activity, Newell wished that ‘‘the friends of Immanuel in my Christian
country would shake off their criminal slothfulness’’ and join the efforts
of her and her husband in ‘‘lands where the prince of darkness has long
been adored.’’ ‘‘In this land of darkness,’’ she went on, ‘‘where the enemy
of souls reigns triumphant, I see the blessedness, the superior excellency
of the Christian religion.’’ <sup>43</sup>
</p>

<p>
Many missionaries also suffered from homesickness; unlike merchants, they
tended to spend far more time amongst native peoples. Many studied Indian
languages and labored carefully to translate the Bible and religious tracts
into the local dialect. Samuel Nott, for instance, worked with a local
Brahmin to learn the Mahratta language while in Bombay.  Across the
subcontinent, missionaries found themselves surrounded by very different
cultures and geographies, mystified by Indian religions, and disgusted by
native rituals and worship. Some began to yearn for the comforts and
company of home. ‘‘Let no one think of being a missionary,’’ Richards
wrote, ‘‘unless he is willing to encounter trials . . .  which result from
a want of christian society and example.’’ The ABCFM missionary Miron
Winslow, who served on the island of Ceylon shortly after Richards’ tenure,
was also struck by the contrast between India and the West. ‘‘On a first
arrival here,’’ he wrote, ‘‘one finds himself so completely in a new world,
that he is bewildered. . . . If the moon should fall from heaven, he would
not be surprised, but think it the way with the Bengal moons.’’
<sup>44</sup>
</p>

<p>
The Indian landscape also displeased American missionaries. For many, the
journey up the Hugli River to Calcutta formed their first taste of the
subcontinent. ‘‘No scenery in nature can afford less pleasure,’’ one
American student wrote on his way to study at Fort William College,
Calcutta, in 1811, ‘‘than the shores of the Hooghly.’’ Over twenty years
later, an incoming agent of the American Missionary Societies, Howard
Malcolm, was similarly disgusted by the Hugli when he visited Calcutta in
the 1830s: ‘‘When the shores are at length discerned,’’ he wrote, ‘‘their
dead level and unbroken jungle, without any sign of population, and the
great breadth of the river, gives the whole an aspect excessively dreary,
well suiting to one’s first emotions on beholding a land of idolatry.’’
To Malcolm, the riparian landscape of the Hugli was also tainted by false
religious practices. When passing Saugor Island, he noted its infamy ‘‘for
being the spot where many infants and others are annually immolated.’’
<sup>45</sup>
</p>

<p>
Yet if missionaries were more apt to degrade the religious culture of
Hindus, they also allowed them the potential of achieving full spiritual
equality through Christ. While The Memoir of Krishna-Pal was composed by
the British General Tract Society, it closely paralleled the views of
American Baptists and was reprinted in Philadelphia. The tract recounted
the conversion and trials of a Hindu man. Suffering persecution at the
hands of Hindus who feared conversion for its upending of the caste system,
Krishna-Pal eventually succumbed to illness, but not before converting to
Christianity and doing a bit of proselytizing himself.  Baptist publishers
settled on Krishna-Pal as a sort of early mascot, using his example as a
means of garnering funds and encouraging missionary work. ‘‘Look at heathen
Krishna,’’ they wrote, ‘‘receiving his idolatrous teacher, washing his
feet, and anointing his head with the dirty water, and look at the same man
sitting with his Christian pastor, or delivering a sermon from the
pulpit.’’ <sup>46</sup>
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
In 1816, the veteran ABCFM missionary Samuel Nott reflected on his
experience in India before a congregation in Franklin, Connecticut. He
described Hindus as slothful, idol-worshipping, sensual, and dirty: ‘‘Some
of the means of attaining the spiritual state,’’ he recounted, ‘‘are, an
entire separation from business, and living by beggary, allowing the hair
and nails to grow untrimmed.’’ Nott found some hope, however, in the global
increase of missionary activities, prophesying that ‘‘the present, may be
the times, in which God designs, the darkness of paganism, to begin
effectually, to dissipate.’’ In the climax of his sermon, Nott called on
farmers and mechanics to become coworkers ‘‘in accomplishing an object, as
momentous as the earth can possibly witness,—the turning of idolatrous
nations to the love and favor of God their Maker.’’ <sup>47</sup>
</p>

<p>
Some Americans heard Nott’s call, and fashioned their country as a key
earthly player in the fulfillment of God’s divine plan. By the 1820s,
members and donors had lifted the income of the ABCFM to $40,000, three
times that of the American Temperance Society. In New York in May 1836, the
American Tract Society claimed that it had dispatched over one hundred
thousand tracts to India and Sri Lanka. Inspired by the Congregationalists,
other denominations began sending missionaries to India. News of the
Judsons’ conversion prodded American Baptists to found the Baptist Board of
Foreign Missions at a national convention in Philadelphia in 1814. They
appointed Adoniram Judson their first missionary. Likewise, in 1817,
Presbyterians in the American Middle West founded the United Foreign
Mission Society with the goal of propagating the ‘‘gospel among the
Indians of North America, the inhabitants of Mexico and South America, and
in other portions of the heathen and anti-Christian world.’’ The Unitarians
were among the last of the major American Christian denominations to send a
missionary to India, dispatching their first in 1855. The ABCFM had
lifted the vision of American evangelicals to new horizons. <sup>48</sup>
</p>

<p>
American missionary societies were successful in part because they had
mastered the antebellum American press. Replicating the strategies
developed earlier by Britons, American evangelicals understood that the
continuation of their efforts overseas lay in keeping American congrega-
tions abreast of the need and progress of their foreign activities. They
also believed that supporting mission work abroad would help enliven
Christian religion at home. Their books, magazines, and periodicals—
publications like the popular Baptist Missionary Magazine—deluged the
reading public, heralding both their successes as well as the dire
spiritual need of benighted non-Christians. The publication process began
with the missionaries themselves, who wrote home letters intended for the
press. Affective, compassionate, and descriptive, missionaries’ corre-
spondence tended to feature experiences, anecdotes, and stories that were
most likely to move an American reading them at home. These missives often
drew sharp contrasts between the light of Christian knowledge and the
darkness of South Asian paganism. Ideally, they inspired largesse or edged
readers toward a fuller relationship with Christ. Their strategies paid
off; expert advertisers, missionaries and their societies won the
admiration, encomiums, and financial contributions of their neighbors,
congregants, and American society at large. <sup>49</sup>
</p>

<p>
By supporting the foreign missionary movement, Americans helped refashion
their nation’s perception of India and its denizens. No longer a rich and
exotic land, India increasingly became a dark place of superstition and
its natives an ignorant race in need of Western redemptive religion. A
small cadre of devout missionaries had succeeded in relaying their vision
of native India to a larger American audience. ‘‘No European can ever
comprehend an Asiatic,’’ commented one American traveler who visited New
Delhi in the 1850s, ‘‘and that the more their peculiarities are studied,
the more inconsistent they appear.’’ When a European immigrant landed in
New York City in the 1830s, an American missionary handed him a Bible.
Perhaps hungry, the immigrant asked him of its worth. He ‘‘asked me if I
knew the value of it,’’ the missionary remembered, to which ‘‘I said no;
but I would not exchange it for the riches of India.’’ <sup>50</sup>
</p>

<p>
Malcolm, in his 1838 account of his travels to the Orient, contrasted the
departure of the ‘‘regular packet, crowed with passengers’’ and the
merchantman with the missionary. ‘‘Over all the wharf is one dense mass of
grave and silent spectators,’’ he wrote, while ‘‘the full harmony of a
thousand voices wafts to Heaven the touching hymn. . . . [The missionary]
awakens the sympathy of every believer. Stranger though he be, all press to
grasp his hand, and, when gone, all intercede for him with God.  Even
denominational preferences are forgotten,’’ climaxed Malcolm, ‘‘and every
sect mingles in the throng, exulting in a common joy.’’ <sup>51</sup>
</p>

<p>
The dispatch of Malcolm’s missionary was precisely the event that Benjamin
Williams Crowninshield had once railed against in the Massachusetts State
House of Representatives. Nearly fifty years later, former state
representative Oliver B. Morris recalled the debate on a petition by the
ABCFM for a state charter. It had ‘‘occurred in the evening,’’ Morris
remembered, and ‘‘a good many members participated in it.’’ ‘‘Some of
them,’’ he thought, ‘‘exhibited an illiberal spirit.’’ One representative
in particular was distasteful to Morris: ‘‘a member from Salem, who had
been a ship master trading to India, ridiculed the idea of attempting to
carry the gospel to that portion of the heathen world, and said that all
efforts of that kind would be worse than vain.’’ The individual in ques-
tion was Crowninshield, a man who spoke with an intimate knowledge of what
India was and who populated it. His view of Indians, cultivated through
numerous business relationships with talented native merchants, could not
have been more different from the position of the ABCFM. <sup>52</sup>
</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="conclusions">
The American missionary movement in India had been built on the foundations
laid out by the merchant-mariners who had preceded it. As missions gained
steam, they benefited from continued (though diminished) Indo–American
commerce; missionaries relied on American merchantmen for transportation,
communication, and mail service to and from India. Some merchants even
supported missions financially, as did the Salem India trader John Norris,
who donated $10,000 in silver to the Andover Divinity School. By giving
that amount of specie, Norris revealed his commitment to the
Christianization of foreign peoples. Yet many American merchants did not
take to missionaries so easily; when Henry Lee met Gordon Hall and Samuel
Nott in Calcutta in 1812, he described them as ‘‘mad.’’ ‘‘All of them,’’ he
wrote, ‘‘seemed ignorant of the world, and extremely ill-informed of the
country and inhabitants which they came to convert.’’ Other merchants
sounded similar opinions, and doubted how effective American missionaries
could be in converting native Indians. ‘‘They never have yet made a
convert,’’ William Rogers wrote of the Bombay missionaries in 1817, ‘‘nor
will they by the means now used.’’ <sup>53</sup>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, by the late 1830s, a new kind of American traveler had
largely replaced the Salem and Boston merchant-mariners as the pre-
dominant intermediaries between the United States and native India; whereas
merchant-mariners had once returned to America with stories of ‘‘the
amiable manners of that mild, much misrepresented people,’’ missionaries
wrote home of the ignorant condition of native Indians and implored
Christian assistance. Far from denying missionaries’ aid, Americans were
now crowding docks and quays to see such men depart. <sup>54</sup>
</p>

<p>
The merchant-missionary divergence may be partly attributed to the
differing professional impulses that pushed members of each group to voyage
to India. While neither occupation was entirely monolithic, American
merchant-mariners and missionaries journeyed abroad with markedly different
motivations and agendas. Their experiences in the subcontinent varied by
individual, but they also differed by profession.  Generational factors may
have played a role as well: America’s early India traders were products of
the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, while the nation’s missionary
pioneers were the children of religious revivalism. Increasingly, the
latter looked toward the nineteenth century as an age of global spiritual
renewal through Christ. In the end, the encounters of Benjamin W.
Crowninshield and Samuel Nott with native India may have had as much to do
with what they brought to the subcontinent as to what was actually there.
</p>

<p>
In the transition between these two views lies a critical transformation in
the way in which Americans perceived themselves, their role in the world,
and distant nations. While this article has largely dealt with the Indian
world, similar patterns may be detected in the changing relationships
between the United States and other, non-Western parts of the globe in the
early nineteenth century. The rise of biological racialism, Westward
expansion, and the development of the Old South also played significant
parts in bringing about this shift. Yet maritime economics may have also
had a role: As the American productive economy turned to satiate more
domestic demands in the opening decades of the nineteenth century, sailors’
eyewitness contributions to Americans’ understanding of foreign peoples may
have decreased. ‘‘America is a brown-water nation, with a blue-water
consciousness,’’ assert the authors of a recent survey of American maritime
history, noting that ‘‘early in the nineteenth century, Americans began
trading more with themselves than they did with the rest of the world.’’
When they did, Americans might have lost more than access to exotic
markets: they may have exchanged one set of eyes for another. <sup>55</sup>

2. The merchant-mariners examined in this article were the minority of
Americans visiting India in the early republic. Scores of common sailors
accompanied every supercargo and sea captain who traded abroad. Ship logs
and journals, consular and British court records hold clues to the
experiences of the ordinary seamen in British India. Yet unfortunately, in
contrast to the men who commanded them, the jack tars who visited India
have left very few written documents for posterity. Resurrecting the lives
and experiences of these men who were engaged in the American India trade
would be a difficult, but not impossible, enterprise.

<h3>How do historians undertake scholarly conversations?</h3>
<p>Scholarship by historians is primary communicated via monographs however there are several significant journals published to promote scholarly communication through the dissemination of information relevant to scope of the publication. Typically, these publications are associated with a particular professional association. For historians, two of the most important professional associations are the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, but there are also specialized associations who focus on specific geographical or topical areas. For instance, the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic publishes the journal in which the example article is published. The governing administration of the association establishes guidelines and publishing standards carried out by an editorial body that oversees the production of the publication.</p>

<h3>What are the research methods used by historians?</h3>
<p>Historians generally construct a research question that explores change over time of an issue, event, or location. They construct their research questions very carefully and are generally answer these questions using a pool of primary sources. Primary sources provide historians with their principal form of evidence by offering substantiation for the claims made by the scholar. In historical practice, primary source are understood to be direct evidence from a particular time period. Historians also rely heavily on the work of previous scholars. These secondary sources fill in gaps and provides more context for reader. Further, the synthesis of primary and secondary sources allows the author to demonstrate the significance of their work to the field.</p>

<h3>How does publication work in historical disciplines?</h3
<p>When historians have an article they want to submit they can look for a journal that falls within the scope of their work and examine the submission requirements. This information often includes a length requirement as well as format standards. Typically, journals specify their citation standards in these requirements; in History, the most common citation standard is the Chicago Manual of Style footnote style. Some journals have an extensive peer review process but others rely primarily on their editorial staff to review submissions. For those journals with a peer review process, submitted articles are generally sent anonymously to two to three expert readers, who typically approve for publishing, ask the author to revise and re- submit for consideration, or reject the submission.In addition, journals provide information that describes their governance, scope and general information regarding the extent of their circulation. Journals also provide information for those that want to subscribe and what databases provide access to their content.</p>

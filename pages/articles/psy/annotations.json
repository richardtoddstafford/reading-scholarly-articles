    "string": "If a study is supported by grant funding, organizations providing financial support are stated here. The funding of a study is uncontroversial, but some scholars Robert Cialdini and Sergio Sismondo have shown evidence of what is called a “funding bias,” especially in psychiatric research."

This part of the article provides each author’s professional credentials (PhD, MA, MS) and institutional affiliation (university, hospital, research center) should be clearly stated on the title page.  You can use the credentials and institutional affiliation to find more out about each author, for instance whether a specific article is part of a larger body of work on a topic, what additional qualifications the author might have to write on a topic, and even what conflicts of interest a scholar might have.

    "title": "Literature Review",
    "string": "Generally found in the introduction or in its own section at the beginning of psychology articles, the literature review is where an author demonstrates how the research responds to- and extends- the existing scholarly knowledge about a topic.  It is often useful to think about the literature review as a kind of map to the scholarly conversations in which an article intervenes.  By establishing what was already known before a study and what debates are ongoing in the field when a study is published, the literature review will help you make sense of the significance of a research question."

    "id": "#question",
    "title": "Research Questions",
    "string": "Research questions are a set of questions that an article sets out to answer based on what is already known and what seems important to figure out, based on the existing literature. In some psychological research papers, the research questions will be explicitly stated, but often they will be implicit in the introduction."

    "title": "Hypothesis",
    "string": "This is a statement about what a psychologist or behavioral scientist thinks will happen in a study, based on the theories, models, or empirical observations that already exist in the scholarly literature.  The research method is designed to test the hypothesis.  If a hypothesis is shown to be false, then it may be evidence that the model or theory needs to be revised, extended, modified, or even abandoned."

    "id": "#method",
    "title": "Method",
    "string": "The research method describes the design of the study: how was evidence collected and processed in order to test a hypothesis or answer a research question. It typically is divided into several sections corresponding to the different parts of the research design."

    "id": "#subjects",
    "title": "Subjects",
    "string": "The Subjects section lists characteristics of the individuals or groups studied.: age, sex, education, occupation.  It will generally describe how subjects were selected. When evaluating psychological research, it is very important to pay attention to the number of subjects (also referred to as the “sample size” or “N”), whether the characteristics of the subjects seem representative of the groups the study purports to study, and whether the number of subjects is enough to justify the inferences the scholar makes. "

    "title": "Materials",
    "string": "The materials section describes all equipment or tools needed for the study. Generally, you will be able to find several studies using similar equipment or tools, which will enable you to compare the research design and methods different scholars use when deploying these tools.  Some tools, like Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are nearly ubiquitous in contemporary research.  Even when standard tools like fMRI are used, it is worthwhile to pay attention to the way that different scholars are using these tools and to attend to what kind of data is generated using them."

    "title": "Procedure",
    "string": "The procedure section describes experimental design, dependent/independent variables, controls, method of subject assignment and step by step description of how the study was taken out. A critical eye will notice that the quality of experimental procedure varies from experiment to experiment."

    "id": "#iv",
    "title": "Independent Variable",
    "string": "The independent variable is the aspect of the experiment that the scholar manipulates with the expectation of some resulting effect. Common independent variables may include exposure to specific stimuli, experimental conditions, or medications."

    "title": "Control Group",
    "string": "Many experiments will include a control group who are not exposed to the stimulus under study. This enables the researcher to have a baseline against which to compare the effects of the experimental conditions."

    "title": "Discussion",
    "string": "The discussion section interprets the data and reports the outcomes from the study. The discussion will tie the outcomes to the literature review and hypothesis, acknowledge limitations of the study and suggest implications for future research. When reading the discussion section, you will want to evaluate whether there are other possible interpretations of the data, how other scholars have made inferences from similar data, and whether the inferences or interpretations presented seem plausible, based on the other scholarly literature in the field."

    "title": "references",
    "string": "The references sections in the behavioral sciences use APA format (American Psychology Association Style Guide, 6th edition), are listed alphabetically by the last name of the first author, and should be only references cited in the paper.  It is a good idea to look at the references that investigated similar themes to a study in order to better understand the scholarly conversations in which it participates."

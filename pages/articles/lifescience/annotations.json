For example, many scholarly journal titles contain the words Journal of, Review, or Quarterly. Although this journal title (PLoS Biology) does not contain these words, the title includes the name of its reputable open access publisher -- PLoS (Public Library of Science) and states its disciplinary focus (biology). Scholarly journals are published or sponsored by a scholarly publisher, a professional society, or a university press. PLoS currently publishes six peer-reviewed journals that feature research of significant impact. When you are unfamiliar with a publisher or sponsoring organization, you may need to conduct some research in order to determine its credibility."

This article has six authors, each of whom names his institutional affiliation. For example, the first author's affiliation is Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America. Note that the authors of this article are affiliated with different institutions which are located in different states. Multidisciplinary and multi-institutional scholarly collaboration is typical for life sciences research."

The abstract is a summary of the research project, its methodology and results, and the authors' conclusion(s). This article's abstract describes the research question (why the flu virus in humans is less diverse than that in wild birds?), the research project (the surveillance of avian influenza viruses in wild birds), methodology (statistical analyses), research results (a combination of characteristics of the host and virus explains the diversity observed), and the authors' conclusions (the key to maintaining the high levels of influenza diversity observed in wild birds is due to the combination of their short lifespan as well as the greater durability of viruses in aquatic environments)."

This article elaborates on the specific types and subtypes of the avian flu viruses (in wild birds and in humans) and explains why this research study was important to undertake (because of the recent avian influenza viruses as pandemic threats)."

It can take some effort to understand the relationships between a hypothesis, the research methods used to test this hypothesis, the evidence gathered using these methods, and the inferences made from that evidence in order to substantiate or falsify the hypothesis. In many cases, the goal of a methods section is to provide a description of the methods that is detailed enough that someone with appropriate knowledge could replicate the study."

In the life sciences, scholarly articles often report the results of empirical research that is derived from observation or experiment.  In the Results and Discussion section, the authors of this article describe the types of data they used for their study (experimental data and sequence data from GenBank) and the methods they used to conduct the study (experiments, comparison, testing, and the time series, phylogenetic and regression analyses).  They also report the results of their study that showed that the contrasting degrees of viral diversity can be explained by properties of both host and virus."

<h3>What do life scientists study?</h3>

<p>The most intriguing aspect of the life sciences as an academic and research field is its breadth and complexity. It encompasses the scientific study of all living organisms, from microorganisms to human beings, and draws on a range of disciplines, including biology, botany, zoology, molecular biology, microbiology, and physiology.</p>

<h3>What are some of the relationships between the life sciences and other disciplines?</h3>

<p>Life scientists often utilize computational techniques borrowed from other fields such as computer science, statistics, and information technology. The collaboration of several disciplines has become a common trend and led to the rise of such new cutting-edge fields as bioinformatics, bioengineering, systems biology, and neuroinformatics. The combined strength of scientific collaboration among several disciplines has brought life scientists closer to an understanding of living systems across multiple levels of biological organization and improved their ability to understand the root causes of human, animal and plant diseases and find cures for them. The impact of life sciences research is not limited to the healthcare field. It has practical applications in environmental science, biotechnology, and agriculture, for example, in genetic engineering of drought-and-disease-resistant plants, microbial genome alternations for energy production, environmental cleanup, and industrial processing and waste reduction.</p>

<h3>How is research in the life sciences changing?</h3>
<p>  	
	The environment in which the life sciences research operates has changed dramatically during the past decade. The emergence of high-throughput computational techniques, also known as “omics,” has revolutionized the research paradigm of the life sciences. These techniques have produced such vast quantities of complex biological data that software tools have been designed by experts in the field in order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of these data. This confluence of technological and scientific advancements, coupled with the power of the Internet, enabling researchers to communicate with colleagues more quickly and efficiently and to share biological data with other scientists in a collaborative way, have dramatically improved the productivity of life sciences research. It has taken it from a place where it was common to study a biological problem one gene at a time to today’s standard where it is common to model multiple genes working together and performing complex biological functions.  It has enabled life scientists, in just over a decade, to map the entire human genome and genomes of many other life forms.</p>
	
<h3>How are research results communicated in the life sciences?</h3>
<p>	The idea that a research lifecycle is incomplete until research results are disseminated is one of the fundamental principles of research. Not only do researchers strive to share the results of their work with the public and their peers but they also need to ensure that their research findings are original. While the highlights of discoveries in the life sciences are often described in mass media and, later, in books, the details and results of current research studies are largely reported through articles in peer-reviewed journals that provide quality control (through the peer-reviewing or refereeing process), draw together research papers on particular subjects, and organize the distribution of research. Articles in a peer-reviewed journal must pass the strict review of three or more "peers" who are experts in the field or on the research topic of the article. Keep in mind that book reviews and editorials are not considered scholarly articles, even when found in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>Life sciences research is almost exclusively reported through articles in peer-reviewed journals (versus through monographs) for three reasons. The first reason is that scientific research results are often time-sensitive, especially in the biomedical fields, and the rapid accumulation of knowledge and data forces them to publish research findings as quickly as possible. The second reason is that scientific research findings tend to go out of date more quickly than in other disciplines, largely because of the rapid changes in information technology and research methodology. Finally, peer-reviewed journals dominate scholarly communication in the life sciences (as well as in other academic fields) because the publication of peer-reviewed articles, especially in the journals with high impact factors, is one of the most important criteria for promotion and tenure in academia.</p>

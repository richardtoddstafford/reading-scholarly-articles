We owe the first recorded moment of ecological insight in British North America
to Stephen Parmenius, intended chronicler of Sir Humphrey Gilbert's ill-fated
second voyage of 1583.<sup>1</sup> Gilbert, originally hoping to establish
acolony in what is now New England, stopped off for provisions at St. John's
harbor, Newfoundland, where an international fishing fleet had made its base.
According to the terms of his patent, Gilbert took possession of the territory
on which the fisherman had established drying stations and let these lands back
to them as his tenants. Anxious to search for ores and other resources that
could support acolony there, Gilbert and company found it difficult toget
inland. Parmenius reported, in a letter to the younger Richard Hakluyt, that
the thick woods "so hynder the sighte of the Lande, and stoppe the way of those
that seeke to travell, that they can goe no whither. <sup>2</sup>To gain an
unobstructed view and entry into the interior, Parmenius urged Gilberto burn
the woods, but Gilbert refused,
</p>

<blockquote>
for feare of great inconvenience that mighthereof insue: for it was reported
and confirmed by verie credible persons, that when the like happened by chance
in another Port, the fish never came to the place about it, for the space of 7.
whole yeere after, by reason of the waters made bytter by the turpentyne, and
rosen of the trees, which ranne into the ryvers upon the fyring of
them.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can now infer that it was not pine sap but soil erosion from the burned-off
shore that polluted the estuary for seven years, until new growth stabilized
the banks.<sup>4</sup> Gilbert and his crew, however, interpre this "verie
credible" story of environmental interaction in a different way, seeing therein
a relationship among the commodities of the New World. They imagine so much sap
being released in a fire that it cannot burn off but instead renders enormous
amounts of its primary distillate, "turpentyne," and a by-product of
distillation, "rosen."<sup>5</sup> The superfluity of these commodities courses
down the banks, turning the water "bytter" and obstructing the harvest of
another commodity, fish.
</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="method">
Reading Parmenius's letter from Newfoundland, we imagine what Gilbert imagined
- a narrative of environmental interaction - but we understand its causal
mechanism differently. This difference alerts us to Gilbert's interest in the
economic dimension of environmental representation. Economy enters Gilbert's
environmental understanding under the category of commodity, which to him means
both a specific good or resource and, more generally, due measure, fitness, or
convenience. As the younger Hakluyt would argue in the "Discourse of Western
Planting" (1584), the "manifolde comodyties that are like to growe to this
Realme of Englande by the Westerne discoveries lately attempted" included
economic recovery, full employment, trade with indigenous Americans, discovery
of a Northwest passage, geopolitical advantage relative to Spain and other
European nations, the extension of Christendom, the glory of the Crown, and so
on - as well as particular goods (<em>0</em>, 2:211). Promising new
possibilities for commodity in the most general sense, the American environment
invited the English to develop a new mode of political economy, one that
theorized economics in terms of environmental cpacity in a way that the
then-dominant mode, agrarianism, had not yet done. This economic theorizing was
a primary concern of the promotional literature of the late sixteenth century
(and beyond), significantly shaping its generic conventions and motivating its
cultural work.<sup>6</sup>
</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="theory">
Promotional literature's fundamental linkage of economics and the environment
invites us to read the genre in terms of steady-state or sustainable economic
theory. While recent years have seen the rise of both the "new economic
criticism" and ecocriticism, literary critics have been slow to investigate in
detail the interrelation of economy and ecology.<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="question">
In the social and biological sciences, however, the interdisciplinary field
of steady-state or sustainableconomics has emerged precisely to theorize
this interrelation.<sup>8</sup> Early promotional literature provides an
occasion to bring to bear this field's insights and to open literary
studies onto the nexus of economy and ecology.
</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="litreview">
Sustainable economics works in systemic terms, describing the economy as an
open subsystem of the ecosystem: the economy "tak[es] in useful (low-entropy)
raw material and energy" from the natural environment while "giving back waste
(high-entropy) material and energy" for the natural environment to absorb and,
to some extent, "reconstitute .. . into reusable raw materials."<sup>9</sup>
Sixteenth-century promoters of colonization addressed asimilar set of concerns
about inputs, outputs, and boundaries. Participating in the consolidation of
economics as a distinct field during the latter part of the sixteenth century,
the promoters began to define the English nation as an economy and to
understand it as a system.<sup>10</sup> They argued that the well-being of the
realm depended on opening this system to New World environments and, to some
extent, closing it off from other Old World economic systems.<sup>11</sup>"
Inspeculating on the expansion, boundaries, and limits of the economy, they
redefined existing economic terms such as commodity, waste, and vent in
relation to the capacities of this new environmental context.<sup>12</sup> With
respect to input, one of the primary concerns of sustainable economics, the
early promoters argued that more commodities-more oil, more timber, more wine,
more gold, and so on-had to be brought into the English economy, but from New
World environments rather than European trading partners. As for output, the
early promoters could not theorize the accumulation of antiproductive waste,
since early modern technologies did not stress the environment's absorptive
capacity in the way that today's technologies do.<sup>13</sup> Even so, both in
seeing the New World as an outlet for one kind of waste (people) and in
speculating on the transformation of that waste into productive resources, the
promoters pointed toward sustainable economics' understanding ofthe relation of
output to environmental absorption and transformation.
</p>

<p>
Seen in this light, early promotional texts compel the attention of anyone
interested in a general consideration of ecocritical and ecological issues,
even though they are not what we would call "green" texts.<sup>14</sup> They
are not, for example, antigrowth.<sup>15</sup> On the contrary, in a
proto-Lockean recognition that wealth derives from the human transformation of
the environment, the sixteenth-century promoters articulated, arguably for the
firstime, the paradigm of growth that has since become naturalized in political
and economic discourse.<sup>16</sup> Since sustainable economics is primarily
interested in determining the environmental limits on growth, it provides a
useful theoretical apparatus for understanding the colonial promoters'
theorization of growth and Americans' subsequent economic engagements with the
environment. The early promoters describe the late-sixteenth-century English
economy as increasingly entropic, requiring new capacities for input and output
to achieve a steady state characterized by full employment and social
stability; later promoters, from Edward Johnson to Thomas Jefferson ad beyond,
retained this commitment to growth.<sup>17</sup> Sustainable economics
defines potential inputs and outputs as finite, arguing that the economy cannot
continue to grow indefinitely but "may continue to develop qualitatively"
without growing.<sup>18</sup> While one critique of reading these early texts
through sustainable economics is obvious -it is not clear that the early
promoters recognized absolute environmental limits as such -this point should
not prevent us from thinking through the promoters' originating insight. This
insight, which became invisible to subsequent economists until sustainable
economics brought it again into view, was to theorize the link between growth
(and economic questions generally) and the natural environment.

<p>
Promotional texts written by the elder and younger Hakluyts, Sir George
Peckham, Christopher Carleill, and others during the late sixteenth century
shared a particular economic narrative regarding New World environments.
According to this narrative, England was suffering from an unfavorable balance
of trade caused largely by the decline of its textile industry. More raw wool
and less finished cloth were being exported to uncertain and diminishing
markets, while imports of other goods had remained steady or increased.
Moreover, in the absence of disease and war, the population was increasing. The
result was widespread unemployment and unrest, and the general impoverishment
of the realm. Colonization would provide a solution to all these interlinked
problems. America's indigenous population could be induced to trade for
finished cloth and/or a large enough colony of English settlers would provide
such a New World market. In return for cloth, the New World promised to supply
all the commodities that England was at the time importing or hoping to import
from enemies or doubtful friends (Spain, Portugal, France, the Levant, Russia)
- and at cheaper rates. Some of the poor could be transported to the colonies,
where they would find employment incommodity production, while those who
remained in England would find employment in both a revitalized wool trade and
new industries based on adding value to import commodities from New World
environments.
</p>

<p>
Early modern England's first theoretical text on colonization, Sir Thomas
More's Utopia (1510), found its inspiration in the Columbian discovery and
located its ideal political economy in the New World, but it showed little
interest in the material specificity of New World environments. In one respect
anticipating the arguments of Thomas Jefferson and Frederick Jackson Turner,
More develops an agrarian theory of the frontier as safety valve, describing
colonization as the best solution to overpopulation and thus a means by which
an ideal society could be maintained. When the population of Utopia exceeds a
fixed quota, its citizens colonize the "nexte lande where the inhabitauntes
haue muche <em>waste and vnoccupied grounde</em>" ("<em>agri ...  cultu
uacat</em>").<sup>19</sup> The Utopian economic base (which resembles that of
agrarian England in important respects) is replicated on this "waste" land.
Such a view of colonization established an assumption that would become crucial
in legitimating the appropriation ofindigenous Americans' land: the natives are
assumed not to cultivate the land.  They can either join with the Utopians, who
will make the land abundantly productive, or resist colonization, in which case
they will be driven off by war, for the Utopians consider it just to wage war
to bring "voyde and vacaunt" ("<em>inane ac uacuum</em>") land into cultivation
(<em>U</em>, 67; CW, 136). While it would be over a century before the English
prosecuted such a war of conquest in America, More's passage on colonization
registers the important characterization ofNew World land as "waste," even
though inhabited, which was taken up by the late sixteenth-century promoters.
</p>

<p>
More's Utopians do not colonize to gain commodities for import 
or trade, since the realm produces abundant quantities of all goods, 
which are free for the taking in the marketplaces. Nevertheless, complications
introduced by their import of iron, gold, and silver suggest 
a conflict between two ideologies of national wealth in sixteenth-century
England, the dominant agrarianism and emerging mercantilism.<sup>20</sup>
Like the natives in More's source text, Vespucci's account 
of the New World, the Utopians are supposed to regard gold and silver as
valueless within their own society (<em>CW</em>, 428). They use these 
metals to fashion chamber pots and chains for slaves, storing them 
in these forms in case they should have to pay tribute to avoid a 
war. Yet the paradox involved in their "ritual debasement" of these 
metals suggests, as numerous commentators have pointed out, the 
repression of a desire for their evidently innate value.<sup>21</sup> Thus while 
More advances the Utopian theory of colonization in the name of 
agrarianism - an ideology of use value in which iron is valuable but 
gold and silver are not - the Utopians' import of precious metals hints 
at, if only by way of prohibition, an ideology in which trade is the 
primary source of wealth. Importing the iron necessary for agriculture
and manufacturing seems less ideologically charged, but in one 
respect it is even more revealing; it indicates that their agrarian economy
is fundamentally dependent on trade, though the Utopians do 
not fully realize this dependence.<sup>22</sup> To pursue the analogues in
England: colonization practice embodied agrarian theory during most 
of the sixteenth century in the effort to colonize Ireland, which the 
English represented as a waste region inhabited by an uncivilized 
people.<sup>23</sup> At the same time, mercantilism was beginning to describe 
the English economy's dependence on trade, but it had not yet theorized
colonialism as a means of securing a new source of inputs. 
The most important sixteenth-century mercantilist text, <em>A Discourse 
of the Commonweal</em> (written 1549, revised c. 1576, published 1581), 
identified a negative balance of trade in contemporary England. Yet 
even in the face of evidence that Spanish gold from the New World 
was a significant cause of the problem, this treatise proposed purely 
domestic means to correcthe imbalance, "first, by staying of wares 
wrought beyond the sea which might be wrought within us from 
coming to be sold; secondly, by staying of our woolens, tins, and fells, 
and other commodities from passing over unwrought," and thirdly by 
instilling good order among the laboring classes.<sup>24</sup> Some commodities 
must always be imported, "since men will needs have silks, wine, and 
spice," but if England's manufactures were to be sufficiently developed,
the overall balance of trade with other Old World nations would 
promote economic recovery.<sup>25</sup>

    <h2>Input: Commodity</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Beginning in the 1570s, promotional writers grafted this emergent mercantilist
ideology onto the existing agrarian theory of colonization in order to
articulate, in a new literary genre, a new practice that would account for the
import of "silks, wine, and spice" that was troubling England's economy. Their
first and most obvious step was to identify specific new sources of inputs,
apoint of no concern to More's Utopians. Thus the memorandum that the elder
Richard Hakluyt prepared in 1578 for Sir Humphrey Gilbert's first voyage - a
text that, brief as it is, establishes certain conventions of the promotional
tract genre, such as its georgic imagination of labor - advises prospective
colonists to "discover al the naturall commodities" of the country and proceeds
to discuss means of production (0, 1:118).<sup>26</sup> If, for example, there
are flats on the shore and the sun is hot enough to evaporate sea water, "then
may you procure aman of skill" to make salt, "and so you have wonne one noble
commoditie for the fishing, and for trade of marchandize." Or, "if the soyle
and clymate bee such as may yeelde you the Grape as good as that" in Portugal,
Spain, or the Canaries, "then there resteth but a woorkeman to put in execution
to make wines, and to dresse Resigns of the sunne" (0, 1:118).
</p>

<p>
Unlike More's Utopians, the Hakluyts and their cohort see colonizable
environments as both empty and full. The Utopians replicated their agrarian
political economy by colonizing the "waste," "voyde and vacaunt" land held by
less civilized peoples. The promoters similarly propose colonizing what they
called the "waste Contries" of the New World (0, 2:319), but they emphasize not
the vacancy but the fullness of these new environments. They regard the
indigenous inhabitants less as people to be conquered than as prospective
trading partners. They value the physical environment for what it produces
naturally as well as for what it could be made to produce.  Following the
theory of climate advanced in Aristotle's Meterologica, the promoters assume
that latitude predicts weather and other environmental factors
(<em>climata</em> being the classical geographic term for latitudinal bands of
the globe), so that Old World environments can simply be mapped laterally onto
New.<sup>27</sup> Surveying extant reports on these latitudes in his
compendious "Discourse of Western Planting," the younger Hakluyt argues "that
this westerne voyadge will yelde unto us all the commodities of Europe,
Affrica, and Asia, as farr as we were wonte to travell" in previous trading (0,
2:222). He begins at 30 degrees, Florida, and continue systematically north to
63 degrees, Newfoundland, more or less correlating commodities to climate
according to Old World patterns. The promoters were also interested in what was
unique to the New World, but less so in the early stages.  Hakluyt describes
sassafras at length, for example, but does not yet mention tobacco. "As for
Tobacco," Captain John Smith would later recall, "wee never then dreamt of
it."<sup>28</sup>
</p>

<p>
Many of the desired commodities were derived from Mediterranean cultivars.
Emphasizing this category in the summary of his climatic survey, Hakluyt
asserts that the North American soil in general is "apte to beare olyves for
oile, all kindes of frutes as oranges, almondes, filberdes, figges, plomes,
mulberies, raspis, pomi appij, melons, all kindes of odoriferous trees and date
trees, Cipresses, Cedars, bayes" (0, 2:232-33). If the first item on Hakluyt's
list strikes contemporary readers as especially curious, in his time it was
especially significant, serving as a synecdoche for the replacement of trade
for Mediterranean commodities in general and reaching to the heart of England's
most important industry, wool fabrication. The wool had to be cleaned with
large quantities of soap made from sweet oil; soap made from animal products
gave the finished cloth an unpleasant odor.<sup>29</sup> Domestic
experimentation with vegetable oils-for example, rapeseed-had not been
successful; thus the elder Hakluyt noted in 1582 that oil was still the one
thing that England could not supply to its own wool industry (0, 1:189-90). The
Mediterranean was of course the greatest source of olive oil, but to trade with
"Barbarye, Spayne, Portugale, [or] Italy" was, as Hakluyt remarked, to
"inrytche our doubtfull frendes and infydelles as nowe by our ordynary trade we
doe" (0, 2:341).
</p>

<p>
Colonial promoters were reluctant to give up their goal of replicating Old
World commodity environments, even as they gained more experience of America.
Thomas Hariot's A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia
(1588) is a case in point. Having spent some time in Virginia, Hariot could
attend more closely than the Hakluyts to the specificity of the environment. He
seems quite interested in tobacco, for example, yet he does not treat it in the
section on "Merchantable commodities"; instead, he describes it in the section
on "victuall and sustenance of mans life, usually fed upon by the naturall
inhabitants; asalso by us, during the time of our abode," along with beans,
corn, pumpkins, and the like.<sup>30</sup> On the lookout for familiar
commodities, Hariot begins his account with "Silke of grasse, or Grasse silke.
There is a kind of grasse in the country, upon the blades whereof there groweth
very good silke in forme of a thin glittering skin to be stript off." This
promise is confirmed by the fact that "the like groweth in Persia, which is in
the selfe same climate as Virginia, of which very many of the Silke works that
come from thence into Europe are made." He describes the environmental
transformation necessary to fulfill this promise: although "there is great
store thereof in many places of the countrey growing naturally and wild,"
yet "if it be planted and ordered as in Persia, it cannot in reason be
otherwise, but that there will rise in short time great profit to the
dealers therein.... And by the meanes of sowing and planting it in good
ground, it will be farre greater, better, and more plentifull then it is"
(68). Hariot's desire for Old World commodities leads to some mistakes;
what he took for silk grass was probably yucca.<sup>31</sup> Even so, his
experience of Virginiand his skill as a naturalist temper his projections
to some extent, uniquely among the early promoters. While he knows that a
source of oil is especially important, he does not propose growing olives
as other promoters do. Instead, he goes to great lengths to identify local
substitutes, arguing that "a commodity ...  may be raised" of "Oke-akornes"
or "two sorts of Walnuts, both holding oile," and reclassifying the
"fatnesse" of bears, which "because it is so liquid, may well be termed
oile, and hath many speciall uses" (70). The most environmentally sensitive
of all early promoters of American colonization, Hariot nevertheless
maintains their Old World frame of reference while enlarging their
fundamentally economic characterization New World
environments.<sup>32</sup>

    <h2>Output: Waste</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
While the hope of replacing Old World commodity sources defined 
the relation between economy and environment in terms of input, the 
question of output was more complex. This complexity is evident in 
the elder Hakluyt's innovative use of the term waste. In his "Inducements
to the Liking of the Voyage intended towards Virginia, " written 
for Sir Walter Ralegh in 1584, Hakluyt advises that
</p>

<blockquote>
since great <em>waste</em> Woods be there, of Oake, Cedar, Pine, Wall-nuts, and
sundry other sorts, many of our <em>waste</em> people may be imployed in making
of Ships, Hoies, Busses and Boats; and in making of Rozen, Pitch and Tarre, the
trees naturall for the same, being certeinly knowen to be neere Cape Briton and
the Bay of Menan, and in many other places there about. (0, 2:331, emphases
added)
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage encapsulates the English history of the term waste and
participates in its conceptual transformation by applying it to both the
potential of the land as commodity environment and the potential of people as
labor power; the passage thus rethinks waste in terms of productive capacity.
The discovery of economic inputs in America's waste woods reminds us of the
discovery of the untapped agricultural capacity of England's waste lands, as
commons, forests, and fens were enclosed, cut, or drained during the era of
agrarian improvement, especially from the early seventeenth century
on.<sup>33</sup> More than domestic projectors, however, Hakluyt values the
woods precisely in their waste state, for in that state they yield many of the
commodities he seeks. The waste state of the American forests is not, as in
England, merely astage on the way to agrarian land use.
</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="primaryevidence">
Hakluyt's reference to "waste people" is more innovative still, for it engages
the problem of output. Invited by the New World context, his usage in 1584
ante date similar usages in domestically oriented texts.  The OED records the
first application of waste to people as Thomas Nashe's pamphlet, Pierce
Penilesse, published eight years later, in 1592. Like Hakluyt, Nashe is
addressing an economic problem (albeit the much narrower one of providing
better remuneration for professional authors like himself). He similarly
identifies an excess of population in England, which leads to "a certaine waste
of the people for whome there is no vse, but warre"; Nashe suggests staging
more plays as "some light toyes to busie their heads withall" to prevent their
becoming disruptive to the state.<sup>34</sup> In the seventeenth century,
agrarian improvers such as Gervase Markham (in The English Husbandman, 1613)
began to refer to "waste persons" as a domestic source of labor.<sup>35</sup>
The management of this labor power-the transformation of the poor into the
working class-became increasingly important ineconomic analysis over the course
of the century.<sup>36</sup>
</p>

<p>
A conjunction of circumstances and attitudes compelled Hakluyt to conceptualize
the poor as waste. It was a commonplace of the time that England was
overpopulated. One explanation, given by Nashe and numerous others, was that
there had been no wars of late. Thus in a prefatory poem commending Sir George
Peckham's 1583 promotional tract, John Hawkins cites a classical to deal with
this surplus population:<sup>37</sup>
</p>

<blockquote>
The Romains when the number of their people grewe so great, As neither warres
could waste, nor Rome suffice them for a seate.  They led them forth by
swarming troupes, to forraine lands amaine And foundedivers Colonies, unto the
Romaine raigne.<sup>38</sup>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Hakluyt's "waste people" were those who could be "wasted" by war, if necessary
(a sense that continues in our vernacular use of waste as a synonym for kill).
The sense of waste as economic loss or lack of gain also contributed to
Hakluyt's labeling of the unemployed poor as excess, "waste people. "
Christopher Carleill refers to "our poore sorte of people, whiche are verie
many amongst us, livyng altogethere unprofitable, and often tymes to the great
disquiet of the better sort," and similar formulations appear in all
contemporary promotional tracts.<sup>39</sup> The early promoters characterized
this class of people as expendable, a waste, because they were consuming
without producing. They proposed colonization as a means of expelling this
waste from the English economy and transforming it into a productive resource.

    <h2>Boundary: Vent</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Some of the waste people might have found employment in England, 
the early promoters argued, but for the decline of England's primary
industry, wool fabrication. It is telling that despite their assumption 
of the New World's potential to produce everything of the Old World, 
the promoters never suggest wool as a colonial product. Even Peckham,
who (unlike most other promoters) hoped to found a colony 
devoted not only to trade but to extensive agrarian settlement as well, 
does not mention good pasturage among his inducements to colo-
nization.<sup>40</sup> True, the country was mostly wooded, but woods could 
sooner be converted to pasture than to olive groves, as Peckham and 
others repeatedly propose, or to fields of silk grass or woad, as the 
more moderate Hariot would suggest. However, the importance of 
wool production to the mercantile construction of England's national 
image determined its treatment in the promotional literature as a 
commodity in need of a New World vent, or market.
</p>

<p>
The crisis in the wool industry became an important locus for the question of
economic boundaries not only by providing a motive for creating cheap sources
of commodity input (such as oil and dyestuffs), but by impelling merchants to
look for a new vent for the finished cloth. From the mid-fifteenth to the
mid-sixteenth century, England's exports of wool cloth doubled, most of it sold
through Antwerp.  However, in the second half of the sixteenth century,
financial and political crises resulting from Spanish control of the
Netherlands made export difficult, and the cloth trade experienced a
depression.  Trade was developing with more distant markets, such as the Baltic
region and Russia, but these were uncertain markets and involved distant or
difficult routes.<sup>41</sup> Thus all of the 1580s promotional tracts
speculate strongly on a New World wool trade. Fourth among the elder Hakluyt's
"Inducements" for Ralegh's Virginia project (rhetorically subordinate only to
the glory of God, the increase of Christians, and the honor of the Queen) is a
vision of
</p>

<blockquote>
an ample vent in time to come of the Woollen clothes of England, especially
those of the coursest sorts, to the maintenance of our poore, that els sterve
or become burdensome to the realme: and vent also of sundry our commodities
upon the tract of that firme land, and possibly in other regions from the
Northerne side of that maine. (0, 2:327)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hakluyt projects markets among both transplanted English laborers and
indigenous peoples, but he remains rather vague about the nature and
development of these markets. Peckham works out more closely the logistics of
the projected wool trade. The indigenous Americans, he argues,
</p>

<blockquote>
so soone as they shall begin but a little to taste of civillitie, will 
take mervailous delight in any garment be it never so simple.... 
The people in those partes, are easily reduced to civilitie bothe 
in manners and garments. Which beeing so, what vente for our 
English clothes will thereby ensue, and howe great benefito all 
such persons and Artificers whose names are coated in the margent
[sidenote: "Clothiers. Wolmen. Carders. Spinners. Weavers. 
Fullers. Sheremen. Diers. Drapers. Clothiers. Cappers Hatters. etc. 
And many decayed townes repayred."], I doo leave to the judgement
of such as are discrete.<sup>42</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
An English trading colony would thus mark the boundary between the English
economy and its outsides, other as yet undeveloped economies whose source of
inputs would be directly from New World nature. Input and output would be
mediated through this boundary.  Here it is significant that despite Hawkins's
invocation of Roman precedent in the poem prefacing Peckham's tract, Peckham
does not promote an imperial vision. Rather than encompassing the world, as the
Roman economy had attempted to do, the English economy would develop within
limits marked by trading outposts. This limitation marks a conflict within
Peckham's text and beyond it, a conflict between ideas about the economics of
colonization and the versions of nationalism implied in those ideas. For the
merchants, colonization was a means of opening the economy, of creating
permeable but distinct boundaries; for the agrarian gentry, colonization
implied the extension of empire, the full subsumption of New World lands under
English law and practice. Only in his address to the merchant class does
Peckham concern himself with the logistics of the vent, for only there can he
think in terms of a clearly defined inside and outside.
</p>

<p>
In late-sixteenth-century promotional literature generally, the term
<em>vent</em> brings together etymologies of sale (<em>vendere</em>,
<em>vendare</em>) and outlet (<em>ventus</em>). To pursue these etymologies
fully through the Old French to their Latin origins - a pursuit complicated by
the fact that it is "adventurers" (to come, to chance, <em>venire</em>) who
speculate on the vent of commodities -could involve us in a Nabokovian game of
word golf.  It is enough here to identify the convergence of <em>vendere</em>
and <em>ventus</em>, which indicates both a boundary pierced by an opening and
sales seen from the point of view of the seller - a logic of supply and outflow
rather than demand and inflow. The other frequent term in this literature for
the export sale of commodities, <em>uttering</em> or <em>utteraunce</em>
("out"), carries similar connotations. Fully wrought commodities seem naturally
to seek an outlet, an empty space into which they might be sent.  In this
respect, English goods wanting vent are like the English waste people whom the
promoters identify as a colony's potential labor supply: both need an outlet,
which can be provided by New World environments.
</p>

<p>
In this context, the elder Hakluyt uses the term to develop a conceptual link
between excess people and commodities. In the 1584 "Inducements," he envisions
a "large and ample vente not only of our wolleyn Clothes of Englande but also
of the labor of our poore people at home by sale of Hattes, Cappes, and a
thousande kynde of other wrought ware that in tyme may be brought in use
amounge the people of those Countryes to the great relief of the multitude of
our pore people, and to the wounderfull inrytchinge of this Realme," and he
goes on to describe numerous other productive tasks, under more than twenty
subheadings, for employing the poor in the New World (0, 2:343). He concludes
with an appeal urging "not onlye the marchaunts and Clothiers but alsoe all
other sortes and degrees of our nacion to seeke newe dyscovereyes of peopled
regions for vente of our Idle people, otherwise in shourte tyme many mischeifs
maye ensue" (0, 2:343, emphasis added). While this second use of "vente" refers
explicitly to the transportation of the idle or waste poor to the colonies, it
resonates with contemporary uses of the term to refer both to the commodities
to be wrought by the poor at home and to the labor that, as an abstract
quality, would be embodied in those commodities. English products, English
labor, and even the English people themselves are all poised to take advantage
of the vent offered by New World environments, simultaneously supplying the
English economy with goods and ridding it of its excesses.

Where the elder Hakluyt wrote his promotional texts primarily for the merchant
adventurers themselves, his younger cousin had the opportunity to reshape the
genre for a larger audience. Commissioned by Ralegh to organize information
North America and arguments for colonization into a form that would enlist the
Crown's active support, the younger Hakluyt produced in 1584 "A Particuler
Discourse concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Comodyties That Are
Like to Growe to this Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoveries Lately
Attempted," now generally known as the "Discourse of Western Planting." Perhaps
it was the challenge of locating the merchant adventurers' concerns in relation
to English national identity and policy that drew him, in a key moment, back to
More's meditations on these issues. In the debate concerning England's social
ills in Book 1 of Utopia, the company particularly address themselves to the
increase in crime attendant on widespread unemployment and rising prices. They
are drawn into this debate by the itinerant lawyer Raphael's recollection of a
paradox of crime and punishment noted by one who, in a dinner conversation with
the Archbishop,
</p>

<blockquote>
began dyligently and busily to prayse that strayte and rygorous iustice, which
at that tyme was there executed upon fellones, who, as he sayde, were for the
moste part .xx. [20] hanged together vpon one gallowes. And, seyng so fewe
escapyd punyshement, he sayd he coulde not chewse but greatly wonder and
maruell, howe and by what euill luck it should so cum to passe, that theues
neuertheles were in euery place so ryffe and ranke. (U, 11-12)
</blockquote>

<p>
Raphael argues in reply the economic causes of crime, until the Archbishop
rather tediously turns the conversation back to the more abstract question of
justice. The company, however, are more interested than the Archbishop in
political economy, and so they ask Raphael to describe Utopia.
</p>

<p>
Hakluyt's consideration of England's social ills moves similarly from the
animating topic of crime and punishment to larger concerns of political
economy. Incorporating an economic explanation of crime that Raphael would have
approved into a scene of execution that alludes to More's text, Hakluyt points
out that
</p>

<blockquote>
wee are growen more populous than ever heretofore: . . . yea many thousandes of
idle persons are wthin this Realme, wch havinge no way to be sett on worke be
either mutinous and seeke alteration in the state, or at leaste very burdensome
to the common wealthe, and often fall to pilfering and thevinge and other
lewdnes, whereby all the prisons of the lande are daily pestered and stuffed
full of them, where either they pitifully pyne awaye, or els at lengthe are
miserably hanged, even xxti. at a clappe oute of some one Jayle.  (0, 2:234)
</blockquote>

<p>
Abundance of population and skill turn to excess, waste, and consumption of
resources: "So that nowe there are of every arte and science so many, that they
can hardly lyve one by another, nay rather they are readie to eate upp one
another," as thievery becomes their only economic activity (0, 2:234). Hakluyt
argues that there is not enough wealth in England's economy to support this
unproductive, indeed subtractive activity. In such an entropic situation,
state-imposed deaths, a score at a time on one gallows, seem to provide the
only regulation for a system that cannot regulate itself. More's Raphael had
identified domestic solutions to the problems of poverty and crime, such as
legislation against enclosure, before transporting the reader to a New World
society in which political economy is organized to prevent these problems. Just
as More's Utopians establish colonies to draw off their surplus population,
Hakluyt argues that "yf this voyadge were put in execution, these pety theves
mighte be condempned for certen yeres in the westerne partes." The crucial
difference is that this population would work not so much to support itself as
to produce numerous and varied commodities for English import, and it would
also serve as an export market for English goods (0, 2:234).  Hakluythus
reconfigures subtraction or consumption asoutlet and links it to input,
elaborating the conceptual transformation of waste envisioned by his elder
cousin.
</p>

<p>
Explicitly citing the legal and penal context invited by his engagement with
More, Hakluyt presents the nation with two alternatives: England will continue
to be a land of criminals, jails, and gallows, or it will become a land of full
employment and increasing wealth.  In addressing the Crown, however, he needs
an argument that does more than balance law and economy. The argument he
develops in the concluding section of the "Discourse" proposes a primarily
economic-environmental understanding of English national identity.  Here
Hakluyt returns to another of More's topics, the importance of the wool
industry for England's national well-being, giving it a quite different
interpretation. In Book 1 of Utopia, Raphael describes the effects of
enclosure, a practice necessary for the expansion of wool production: sheep
have devoured the people and depopulated the countryside, turning formerly
cultivated land into wilderness. As one shepherd replaced several plowmen on
estate after estate, the resulting unemployment became a standard theme in the
literature of agrarian complaint, of which More's passage is the most famous
example.<sup>43</sup> Historical evidence complicates this theme, however. Some
of the population forced off the land by enclosure found work in the
cloth-producing districts that began to grow up in the late fifteenth century,
as the wool industry expanded and found export markets on the continent.44 Even
so, the "nostalgic vision" of More's complaint - its implicit appeal to an
idealized set of social relations disrupted by economic transformation -had
great emotional power.<sup>45</sup>
</p>

<p>
It is therefore somewhat surprising that Hakluyt should represent the wool
industry itself, the very emblem of negatively valued modernity in More's text,
as an object of nostalgia in his concluding arguments. Yet this nostalgia is
strategically located in a hypothetical future that England might avoid through
colonization. In this way, Hakluyt taps the power of nostalgia while skirting
any admission of loss. England, he says, "nowe for certen hundreth yeres last
passed" had by virtue of wool production "raised it selfe from meaner state to
greater wealthe and moche higher hono<sup>r</sup>, mighte and power then
before" (0, 2:313). However, with the increase of the Spanish wool trade in the
West Indies,
</p>

<blockquote>
the wolles of England and the clothe made of the same, will become base, and
every day more base then other, wch prudently weyed, yt behoveth this Realme yf
it meane not to returne to former olde meanes [meanness] and basenes, but to
stande in present and late former honor glorye and force, and not negligently
and sleepingly to slyde into beggery, to foresee and to plante at Norumbega or
some like place, were it not for anything els but for the hope of the vent of
our woll indraped, the principall and in effecte the onely enrichinge
contynueinge naturall commoditie of this Realme. (0, 2:314)
</blockquote>

<p>
Making the state of the wool industry a synecdoche for England's national
identity, as other promoters had done, Hakluyt introduces temporal
complications that enable multiple readings of that figure.  He compares
a"former olde" state to a preferable "late former" one, but he has already
described the value of wool as "every day" becoming "more base then the other."
These complications identify the present moment as a balance point, a critical
juncture from which England might or might not "negligently and sleepingly ...
slyde into beggery. "
</p>

<p>
The growth of the wool industry during the fifteenth century, which Hakluyt
views nostalgically from the hypothetical perspective of an increasingly
entropic future, had required an economic and environmental transformation of
the sort that Hakluyt is now inspired to propose on a larger scale for the New
World. In the early to mid-fifteenth century, large landholders, responding to
agricultural depression, had expanded sheep production; as the wool industry
developed, population declined in areas previously devoted to tillage but
increased in new cloth-producing districts. That is, the growth of the wool
trade transformed land use from subsistence to commodity production. A
center-periphery organization emerged, in which the countryside supplied wool
to be worked in the towns. For agrarians such as More, this reorganization was
the target of nostalgic complaint. For Hakluyt it suggested a paradigm for
revitalizing the "decayed townes" that were the objects of his own mercantile
nostalgia (0, 2:235). If England was poised on the brink of irreversible,
entropic decline, "ymmynent mischefe hanginge over our heades," the only hope
of recovery was opening the English economy to the wastes of the New World,
where the native inhabitants still produced at subsistence levels but where the
environment's capacity for greater input and output held the promise of
systemic balance for England's economy (0, 2:314).

<p>
The early promoters' New World speculations took place in a critical historical
moment, after which modern economic and environmental discourses gradually
diverged, to reconverge again only recently.  The larger pattern of this
divergence was to some extent anticipated by local responses to economic
recovery and subsequent depression in the early seventeenth century. Analysts
of the period, in thinking about the economy, looked only to the Old World and
thought only of money. After the stagnation of the cloth industry during the
1590s (which Hakluyt had predicted), treaties with Spain and France opened up
Mediterranean vents for the cloth that Hakluyt would have directed toward the
New World. (This is one reason why England was relatively slow to colonize the
New World.) For these new markets, manufacturers began to produce lighter, less
durable woolens, which provided greater employment than had the heavier,
traditional goods because more labor was required per pound of wool. Soon,
however, foreign competition in these manufactures increased, and the resulting
decline of England's export trade ushered in the depression of the 1620s. In
response, economic analysts formulated a monetarist approach, arguing that the
readily observable outflow of the realm's treasure was caused by an unfavorable
balance of trade, but failing to theorize the root causes of the imbalance.
Concentrating instead on pricing and currency valuation, the economists of the
1620s ignored the environment, giving mercantilism its now-familiar monetarist
character.<sup>46</sup>
</p>

<p>
Viewed in larger historical perspective, the divergence of economic and
environmental discourse followed this general pattern. Agrarianism, as
articulated in More's Utopia and elsewhere, had assumed a closed system in
which wealth, understood as rights to land and its produce, was finite (and, as
the sixteenth-century literature of agrarian complaint argued, unfairly
distributed). The paradigm of growth suggested by the colonial promoters began
to be realized in the 1630s and 1640s, as New World commodities such as
Newfound- land fish and Chesapeake tobacco provided abasis for the economic
recovery that would develop fully after 1660. This paradigm was formalized in
the eighteenth-century classical economic models developed by Adam Smith, David
Ricardo, and the Physiocrats, who criticized the seventeenth-century
monetarists and described growth as requiring an increased input of
environmental resources.<sup>47</sup> Understanding resources primarily as
agricultural land, the classical economists argued that resource-based growth
would be subject to diminishing returns over greater inputs of labor and
capital. Thus their followers soon turned their attention to manufacturing,
which, since machines could be replicated and improved, promised constant or
increasing growth. Neoclassical through Keynesian economic models, assuming the
paradigm of growth, focused on exchange relations, analyzing the
production-consumption cycle and surplus value in ways that closed off economic
theory from any significant consideration of the environment.<sup>48</sup>
Postmodern theorists of exchange, such as Jean-Joseph Goux, have extended this
logic to all aspects of the social, without, however, theorizing any relation
between the social and what is outside it, in effect extending the
neoclassical-Keynesian description of the economy as a closed
system.<sup>49</sup>
</p>

<p>
Ironically, while economic theory increasingly excluded the physical
environment from its domain of analysis, modern environmental science came to
draw on economic models to work out eighteenth-century speculations that there
might be an "economy" of nature itself, representing nature as an interrelated
system of production, consumption, and exchange. But only with the full
development of the concept of the ecosystem-the understanding of nature in
terms of energy systems rather than traditional economic categories-could
environmental science offer economics a significant paradigm in
return.<sup>50</sup> According to this paradigm, the economy is a subsystem of
the ecosystem, conceptually separable but materially dependent on the
ecosystem's capacities to provide low-entropy input and absorb high-entropy
output. More recent ecological theories, which describe nature in terms of
disequilibrium or chaos, have complicated the systems-theory model, making it
more of sustainable inputs and outputs.<sup>51</sup>
</p>

<p>
The promotional writings of the Hakluyts and their cohort develop a
suggestively similar position. That is, in certain respects they return us to
our present crisis. They describe an economy threatened with entropic decay and
see that the reversal of this trajectory must come from a direct engagement
with the physical environment that involves considerations of input, output,
and boundary, commodity, waste, and vent, even if those considerations are
uncertain in theory.  They propose that the health of the economy depends only
on the limits of nature, even if they cannot fully conceptualize these limits.
Since we feel we are much closer to nature's limits (and have more science)
than they, it is easy to criticize them for a failure of insight in this
regard. It is more interesting, as I hope I have demonstrated, to try to
understand them on their own terms. We might go on, then, to consider some
implications of that understanding for literary history and theory,
environmental theory, and practical environmental problems.
</p>

<p class="inline" rel="annotation" id="conclusion">
Although I have charted the historical divergence of economic and environmental
thought, these strands remain interwoven in the American georgic tradition. In
the late eighteenth century, for example, Crevecoeur, Jefferson, Franklin, and
less familiar writers such as Jared Eliot, Benjamin Rush, John Spurrier, John
Filson, and John Lorain debated the effects of various farming methods and land
use patterns on economic structure and sociopolitical stability, in the context
of westward expansion.52 Mapping the relation between the
political-economic-environmental analysis of the sixteenth-century promoters of
American colonization and these later configurations could provide new insights
into American literary history. We might, for example, develop a history of the
category of waste from the Hakluyts' redefinition of the word in terms of
productive resources and labor, through Leather-stocking's land ethic ("Use,
but don't waste"),5 to Don DeLillo's multifaceted meditation on waste in
Underworld; such a history would need to recover the Jared Eliots and Benjamin
Rushes of its trajectory as well.
</p>

<p>
More broadly, attending to the promotional genre's georgic orientation and its
interest in specific environmental capacities might help to reanimate the
question of referentiality in literary theory. As Lawrence Buell argues, where
"our training conditions us to stress the distinction between text and
referent," ecocriticism values the "experiential or referential aspects" of
literature.<sup>54</sup> Yet in his brief reading of Wendell Berry's "On the
Hill Late at Night," Buell demonstrates how even concrete imagery such as
Berry's can lead a reader away from the physical world.<sup>55</sup> The poem's
roots in the pastoral -a mode historically devoted to rural leisure and
contemplation-invite such distancing. By contrast, pursuing asimilar sense of
distancing in a georgic (a mode concerned with labor rather than leisure) such
as Berry's essay "A Good Scythe" would run counter to our experiences of both
mode and topic -if, that is, we have such experiences to draw on.<sup>56</sup>
Since most modern Americans' experience of nature is pastoral rather than
georgic, reading that reminds us of our economic relation to the environment
could help to reorient our common understanding of both literature and nature.
</p>

<p>
We might also use the early promoters' (partial) insights as a point of
departure in distinguishing among current modes of environmental understanding.
For example, we might compare sustainable economics with deep-ecological or
neopastoral approaches. From the latter perspectives, environmental analysis in
terms of economics and energy systems does not seem to offer us a paradigm of
communion with nature, "the arcadian dream of fellow-feeling" promised by a
construct such as Gaia, our latest manifestation of Utopia.57 Yet beyond deep
ecology's exhortation that we recognize anthropocentrism as the root cause of
the environmental crisis and "'work' on [our]selves to cultivate an 'ecological
consciousness,"' it is hard to imagine its tenets manifested in a practical
program.58 Sustainable economics, in contrast, is fundamentally humanist and
takes a more active approach, extending the theoretical work begun by the
colonial promoters, Renaissance men who advised looking "with Argus eies" at
the environment "to see what commoditie" - that is, what measure of
usefulness-"by industrie of man you are able to make it to yeeld" (0, 2:333).
Like Parmenius and Gilbert on the Newfoundland coast, sustainable economics
assumes the authority to make managerial decisions regarding the environment
and attempts to think through the outcomes of those decisions. Like Argus, it
is ever vigilant. Like the colonial promoters, it is sometimes mistaken-yet by
no means always. If Gilbert and Parmenius, learning what they could of New
World ecological history from their "verie credible" sources, had decided to
burn the woods and disturb the fish after all, they would have assumed that
both the woods and the fish would restore themselves in seven years' time. That
is, they would have imagined a human intervention into an ongoing cycle of
consumption, waste, and renewal.  On the other hand, if they chose simply to
let nature alone in this instance, they could not do so in all instances.
</p>

<p>
From a humanist perspective, and following a provisional distinction
between pastoral and georgic, we might map the interrelation 
of aesthetic and economic environmental arguments. To take what is 
for me a local example: Many West Virginians are appalled at mountaintop
removal mining, in which coal operators blast off the top of a 
mountain to get at the coal seam below.59 Our objections may originate 
in aesthetic revulsion-mountaintop removal is ugly-but given the 
development of sophisticated reclamation techniques, coal operators 
can present their course of action as beautiful in the long run. In fact, 
Arch Coal Inc., the leading practitioner of mountaintop removal, has 
been running newspaper and television advertisements depicting reclaimed
surface mines as perfect, pretechnological middle landscapes 
and describing these landscapes as prime wildlife habitats.<sup>60</sup> This 
aesthetic propaganda, while worth combating on its own grounds, 
distracts from human and economic issues. Mountaintop removal 
generates relatively few jobs, and those only for the short term. It 
acidifies streams, destroys well-water sources, and causes flooding. 
It damages homes, forces some people to move out of valleys that 
will be filled with rubble, and reduces property values. It diminishes 
a local economy increasingly devoted to tourism and therefore dependent
on environmental protection. Since mountaintop mines were 
exempted from the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 
1977, state and federal governments will end up funding environmental
repair. None of this is to deny the basic importance of aesthetic 
arguments; it is only to remind us that economic arguments, which 
originated with the sixteenth-century promoters, also play a key role. 
I have not heard anyone quoting Thoreau, much less Gilbert or the 
Hakluyts, in these arguments, but their words resonate for those who 
can hear them.

<strong>6</strong> Whereas the related literary genre of the voyage (for
example, Hakluyt's Principall Navigations) defined England as an economy
related to other national economies, the promotional genre worked out the
relation between the English economy and extra-economic space. On the voyage
genre, see Richard Helgerson, Forms of Nationhood: The Elizabethan Writing of
England (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1992), 151-91.  Conventions of the
early promotional genre include a utilitarian tone, an emphasis on labor, and a
rhetorical structure characterized by figures of blockage or indirection when
the text addresses Europe and figures of openness or expansive vision as it
turns toward the New World. See Wayne Franklin, Discoverers, Explorers,
Settlers: The Diligent Writers of Early America (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago
Press, 1979), 87-94; Jack P. Greene, The Intellectual Construction of America:
Exceptionalism and Identity from 1492 to 1800 (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North
Carolina Press, 1993), 34-46. This figural structure originates in the systemic
understanding of the English economy and its relation to the New World
environment. Such figures persist, for example, in Thomas Jefferson's promotion
of an agrarian-capitalist economy: whereas land in Europe is "locked up against
the cultivator, " America has "an immensity of land courting the industry of
the husbandman" (Notes on the State of Virginia, ed. Frank Shuffleton [New
York: Penguin, 1999], 170). As late as the 1910s, promoters used such
rhetoric-now largely detached from economic theorization-to lure prospective
homesteaders to eastern Montana; see Jonathan Raban, Bad Land: An American
Romance (New York: Vintage, 1997).

energy into the ecosystem ultimately limits the flow of energy from the

this limit is ultimately determined by the planet's capacity to transfer heat
energy to space.

become dominant, it was not the only one available. Gilbert's first voyage
intended to establish a colony only as a pretense for capturing Spanish,
Portuguese, and French shipping; see Andrews, Trade, Plunder, and Settlement,
187. Although Sir Walter Ralegh's Roanoke project was primarily mercantile, his
later report on Guiana disdains trade in favor of conquest in order to
establish military bases against Spain and exact tribute from the natives, for

Encompassing Nature: A Sourcebook (Washington, D.C.: Counterpoint, 1998) and
Michael Branch's forthcoming anthology of pre-Thoreauvian environmental
literature (Univ. of Georgia Press) indicate a broader scope.

<strong>15</strong> To this we could add the charge of anthropocentrism; see
Neil Evernden, "Beyond Ecology: Self, Place, and the Pathetic Fallacy," in
Glotfelty and Fromm, Ecocriticism Reader, 92-104. Yet Buell describes just how
difficult it is for even the most committed ecocentrist to decenter human
subjectivity (Environmental Imagination, 143-79).

<strong>16</strong> As Howard Horwitz points out, whereas the Aristotelian
tradition viewed economics as a matter of "manag[ing] resources ready to hand,
" Locke's Second Treatise "redefined value as the product of human labor
modifying nature" (By the Law of Nature: Form and Value in Nineteenth-Century
America [New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1991], 7). For examples of the
naturalization of the "growth" paradigm, one need only note that Commerce
Department reports of leading economic indicators are routinely analyzed for
evidence of "growth."

<strong>17</strong> In Wonder-Working Providence of Sions Savior in New England
(1651), Edward Johnson narrates the growth of a stable market economy, hoping
to encourage emigration and economic development, which had slowed with the
success of the Puritan revolution in England. On Jefferson's commitment to the
growth of an agrarian capitalist economy, see Joyce Appleby, "The 'Agrarian
Myth' in the Early Republic," in Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical
Imagination (Cambridge: Harvard Univ.  Press, 1992), 253-76.

<strong>20</strong> Although the first official pronouncement on England's
balance of trade came in 1381, the concept did not really catch on until the
sixteenth century.  Mercantilism was not fully recognized as an economic theory
until it became an object of critique for the Physiocrats and Adam Smith; see
Lars Magnusson, Mercantilism: The Shaping of an Economic Language (London:
Routledge, 1994), 9. I am here using "mercantilism" in the very general sense
of the promotion of a favorable balance of trade.

include both a recognition of solar energy as the primary input and a
consideration of waste output.

<strong>48</strong> Daly and Cobb argue that the neglect of the category of
land or resources has been symptomatic of this ever-increasing assumption of
systemic closure. As concern for the productive capacity of physical nature has
become increasingly peripheral within the economic subdiscipline of land
economics, land economics itself has become more peripheral to general economic
analysis. Neoclassical models assume that "capital is a near perfect substitute
for land and other natural resources" (For the Common Good, 97-117, 196).

<strong>57</strong> Worster, Nature's Economy, 315. Worster remains critical of
economistic tendencies, arguing that "communalism must find another source of
intellectual support than the New Ecology" (315). However, Daly and Cobb
specify the primary concern of sustainable economics as "the long-term welfare
of the whole community," defining the individual as a "person-in-community"
"constituted by . .. relations to others"; they argue that "there are
approximations to community participation that can and should characterize
human involvement in the biosphere," even though nonhuman members of the
biosphere do not possess the "level of subjectivity" required to define
themselves as members of a community (For the Common Good, 159, 165, 202).

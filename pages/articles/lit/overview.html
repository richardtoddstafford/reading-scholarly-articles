Literary studies is the study of literature in English and other languages.
In the past, the “literature” that was studied was generally limited to
fiction, poetry, and essays, but that definition has broadened to include
“texts” such as graphic novels, films, advertising, and popular culture.
Formerly, only recognized “canonical” authors such as Shakespeare or T.S.
Eliot might be studied, but over the past few decades, literary studies has
become much more inclusive and diverse. Many literary critics would argue
that the very idea of a “canon” (a list of the “best” works) is deeply
problematic.

A key technique of literary studies is so-called “close reading.” Close
reading means closely studying the actual text (or images, as the case may
be), interpreting that text, and making broader arguments based on those
interpretations. Depending on when the text that you are studying was
created, close reading may involve learning what given words meant in a
given historical period since word meanings change over time. It may also
involve learning more about the historical period that a given work was
created in so that you can better understand the larger context.  In fact,
many literary critics also draw on historical primary sources (texts such
as newspapers or diaries produced in a given time period) to better
interpret a given literary text.

Literary critics often use theories, concepts, and ideas drawn from other
disciplines to help them interpret literary texts. Some theoretical
paradigms that have been influential among scholars of literature have been
drawn from Linguistics, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Economy,
History, and Continental Philosophy.  Literary criticism has also been
influenced by interdisciplinary engagements with the Gender and Sexuality
Studies, Race and Ethnicity Studies, Cultural Studies, and others. These
different perspectives allow literary critics to better understand literary
works and their production.

Engineering is a broad discipline, but all engineers have one thing in
common: they are problem solvers.  Some of the earliest examples of
engineering projects are from ancient times when the Romans built the
aqueducts and the Egyptians built the Pyramids. In the present, engineering
has evolved, diversified and become more interdisciplinary, but the goal is
still the same—to make life better for all people.  This is done through
the design and building of new bridges (civil engineer), the development of
a more reliable power grid (electrical engineer), the invention of the MRI
test for doctors (biomedical engineer), etc.

It is very important that engineers understand the laws of physics,
chemistry and mathematics as they will apply these in their work. Thus, in
order to become an engineer, students must study the theoretical sciences
in addition to mathematics and their engineering classes. As professionals,
engineers will rely on the research from these other fields as it may
affect their designs or inventions.
</p>

<p>
The journal literature is one of the primary ways to share research
information in engineering, although there are others. Scholarly journal
articles in engineering are very important, especially for researchers in
engineering. Each engineering sub-discipline has developed its own set of
scholarly research journals, as well as a number of trade journals. The
publication of research journals in engineering has been controlled mainly
by professional societies, but independent publishers also publish
reputable engineering research journals. Societies publishing journals
(some of them over 100 journals) include the ASCE (civil engineering), IEEE
(electrical and computer engineering, computer science and IT), ASME
(mechanical engineering), and ACM (computer science and engineering, and
IT).

<p>
The peer review process helps establish the reliability of the information
contained within the article and scholarly engineering journals may be peer
reviewed. During this process, submitted papers are reviewed using a double
blind peer review process. The papers are sent to reviewers who are experts
on the subject, but the reviewers are not told the name or institutional
affiliation of the authors. When the authors receive the reviewers’
comments, they are not told the name of the reviewers.
</p>

<p>
In addition to journals in engineering, the interdisciplinary nature of
engineering requires that researchers be aware of research in other fields
and engineering sub-disciplines including medicine (biomedical and
bioengineering), geology (civil engineering), chemistry (environmental
engineering), etc. Mechanical engineering research is used in virtually all
sub-disciplines of engineering, so it is very important to engineers too. 
</p>

<p>
Several other sources of research information are papers presented at
conferences and technical reports.

<ul>
  <li>Conference papers report on recently completed or in progress
  research, so they represent the cutting edge of the field and are
  important in all areas of engineering. Conference papers may be included
  with the society published journals in a library database.</li>

  <li> Technical reports may report on research (especially government
  sponsored research), or they may report on the results of investigations
  or design projects.  This format is particularly important in
  transportation engineering. Many research institutions have put their
  technical reports online to allow open access to their results.  US
  Government sponsored technical reports may be available online or at a
  research library.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Conference papers may be reviewed using a peer review process, but it may
not be as rigorous a review as a journal paper receives. The review of
technical reports is generally not a blind peer review process.  Instead,
subject matter experts in the same or another organization may review the
technical report before its release to the public.

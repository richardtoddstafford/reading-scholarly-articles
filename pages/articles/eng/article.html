    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
State of vigilance is determined by behavioral observations and
electrophysiological activity. Here, we improve automatic state of vigilance
discrimination by combining head acceleration with EEG measures. We
incorporated biaxial DC-sensitive microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
accelerometers into head-mounted preamplifiers in rodents. Epochs (15 s) of
behavioral video and EEG data formed training sets for the following states:
Slow Wave Sleep, Rapid Eye Movement Sleep, Quiet Wakefulness, Feeding or
Grooming, and Exploration. Multivariate linear discriminant analysis of EEG
features with and without accelerometer features was used to classify
behavioral state. A broad selection of EEG feature sets based on recent
literature on state discrimination in rodents was tested. In all cases,
inclusion of head acceleration significantly improved the discriminative
capability. Our approach offers a novel methodology for determining the
behavioral context of EEG in real time, and has potential application in
automatic sleep-wake staging and in neural prosthetic applications for movement
disorders and epileptic seizures.

  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
There is a long history of determining the state of vigilance for humans
(Broughton, 1999) or animals (Robert et al., 1999) using EEG criteria.
Nevertheless, there is considerable uncertainty when determining the state of
vigilance using EEG alone. Therefore, EEG is typically augmented with
simultaneous visual behavioral monitoring, and/or the incorporation of
electromyogram (EMG) or electrooculogram (EOG) recordings.
</p>

<p>
We are developing the technical capability for discriminating state of
vigilance in real time.  Our objective is to provide contextual input for
seizure prediction and control. It is readily accepted that the dynamics of EEG
change remarkably in the different stages of wakefulness and sleep
(Niedermeyer, 1999). Yet much of the current work in seizure detection and
prediction (Mormann, et al., 2005) focuses on statistical or dynamical changes
of the EEG with respect to a baseline defined without regard to state. Our end
goal is to implement state- dependent seizure detection and control in medical
devices suitable for human implantation during the activities of daily living,
where continuous video monitoring would not be feasible and EMG or EOG
electrodes might be invasive or cumbersome.
</p>

<p>
In this study, we explored combining head acceleration measurements with EEG in
order to improve our ability to discriminate state of vigilance in rodent
experiments. We incorporated biaxial DC-sensitive microelectromechanical system
(MEMS) accelerometers into the head- mounted preamplifier circuit used for EEG
recording. We used combined EEG and behavioral video to establish training and
validation data sets, and then used EEG features with and without accelerometer
features in a multivariate linear classifier. We tested a broad range of EEG
feature sets based on those used in the recent literature for state
discrimination in rodents (Robert et al., 1999). Our approach offers a novel
methodology for determining the behavioral context of EEG in real time.
Preliminary results of this investigation were previously reported (Peixoto et
al., 2004, Sunderam et al., 2005).

    <h3>Surgical Implantation and Data Acquisition</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Video (3 fps including visual and infrared sensitivity), EEG and head
acceleration were recorded continuously from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
200–300 g in weight (Harlan Ltd., New York) using a custom-made electronics and
acquisition system (Labview, National Instruments Ltd.).
</p>

<p>
Head-mounted preamplifiers were constructed with integrated DC-sensitive
biaxial MEMS accelerometers (ADXL 311, Analog Devices Ltd.; sensitivity of 312
mV per g, where g = acceleration due to gravity, at the reference voltage of ±5
V, range ±2 g, configured for 0–100 Hz response, Fig. 1). The MEMS chip and
requisite elements for signal transduction (two capacitors and one resistor),
occupy a small fraction of surface area on the circuit board shown in Fig. 1.
The remainder includes the EEG preamplifier and additional elements for
simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording. The minimum additional
surface area required to incorporate such an accelerometer into a final
production headstage is approximately 0.3 cm 2 . The head-mounted preamplifier
was mechanically and electrically attached to the animal’s head through a
Plastics-One (Roanoke, VA) 363 series connector.  EEG was available from two
cortical surface electrode (0–80 stainless steel screw) pairs
(Bregma-referenced stereotaxic coordinates from Paxinos and Watson, 2004: ML
±3.0 mm, AP +0.5 and −0.75 mm) and two depth electrodes (bipolar pairs, 125 μm
stainless steel wires, ends staggered by 300 μm) placed bilaterally in the
dorsal hippocampus (AP −2.5 mm, ML ± 2.0 mm, DV −2.75 mm). Head acceleration
was measured along orthogonal axes in the sagittal plane of the animal’s head
by the accelerometer (Fig. 2). The EEG and acceleration signals were sampled at
2 kHz and stored as 16-bit signed integers in contiguous, one-hour long files.
</p>

<p>
The animals were monitored for up to 7 days in a circular chamber (20 in.
diameter) with free access to food and water. Artificial lighting followed a 12
hour on-off light-dark cycle, and was supplemented with infrared illumination
at 940 nm from photodiode arrays, to allow for continuous video monitoring. We
chose infrared illumination because rats are insensitive to light for
wavelengths above 650 or 700 nm (see for example, Aggelopoulos and Meissl,
2000; or Jacobs et al., 2001), and video cameras sensitive to this wavelength
are readily obtainable. All procedures were approved beforehand by the IACUC of
George Mason University.

    <h3>Visual Expert Scoring of State</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
An EEG expert (SLW) inspected video and EEG to label sequential,
non-overlapping epochs of eleven hours of recording from two rats—identified as
Rat I and Rat II—into the following Sleep-wake stages: 1. Slow Wave Sleep
(SWS), 2. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, and 3.  Awake. Awake motion was
further classified according to visually observed motion to give a total of
five Behavioral states: 1. SWS, 2. REM, 3. Quiet Wakefulness (QW), 4. Feeding
or Grooming (FG), and 5. Exploration (EXP).
</p>

<p>
A fixed 15 s epoch duration was chosen to be consistent with existing
literature on sleep and behavioral staging, in which the use of epochs of
length up to 30 s has been reported (Robert et al., 1999). This length is a
compromise between being long enough to properly discern a state and short
enough to contain a predominantly single state.
</p>

<p>
Expert scoring was performed as follows: First, the video and EEG segment of
each 15 s epoch was reviewed and scored as either Asleep, defined as immobile
activity with oscillations <8 Hz in hippocampal EEG, or Awake. Awake states
were then sub-classified to indicate the nature of motor activity. Sleep states
were sub-classified as either SWS if there was moderate delta (1–4 Hz)
oscillation in the cortex, or REM sleep if there was rhythmic theta oscillation
(6–8 Hz) in hippocampal EEG. Motor and whisker activity were not used to
distinguish sleep states.  Epochs were classified as Indeterminate, if: 1) The
animal was observed to be awake or asleep for less than 10 s, 2) Both EEG sleep
patterns were seen during the epoch, or 3) Brief interruptions of a particular
state occurred, including repositioning during sleep, as well as genuine
transitions between different states. Indeterminate epochs (~10–20% of total,
see Table I) were excluded from further analysis since they can be used neither
for training nor validation of the classifier.

    <h3>Signal Processing and Data Analysis</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Our objective was to compare the ability to discriminate state based on EEG
plus head acceleration features with that based solely on EEG features. We used
a classifier based on EEG that employs power in different frequency bands with
different normalization methods as discrimination variables.
</p>

<p>
Data analysis was performed using Matlab (Mathworks Ltd.). Spectral power was
computed for each of the four EEG and two acceleration channels for each 15 s
epoch as follows: Non- overlapping 1 s windows were convolved with a Hamming
window, the power spectrum computed, then averaged into 0.5 Hz wide bins. The
results were then averaged over the 15 second epoch. The power was summed in
different frequency ranges (see below) and used as input variables or features
for the classification of epochs into the Sleep-wake and Behavioral states
using multivariate linear discriminant analysis (LDA, Flury, 1997). The errors
in classification were compared for different choices of EEG and acceleration
features.

  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h4>EEG features</h4>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Four representative choices of EEG spectral band limits and scaling used for
sleep staging in the recent literature were employed as discrimination
variables for detailed comparison as follows:
</p>

<p>
<em>EEG1.</em> Standard definition of EEG rhythms: Averaged total spectral power for
each EEG channel measured in 4–8 Hz (θ), 8–13 Hz (α), 13–30 Hz (β) and 30–55 Hz
(γ), each scaled by dividing by the power in the δ band (0.5–4 Hz).
</p>

<p>
<em>EEG2.</em> Spectral power ratios (0.5–4.5 Hz)/(0.5–9 Hz) and (0.5–20 Hz)/(0.5–55
Hz), based on Gervasoni et al. (2004). In the published method, the first
principal component of each of these ratios over all EEG channels was used.
Here we use the variables computed for all four channels. The choice not to use
principal components in LDA is explained in the results section.
</p>

<p>
<em>EEG3.</em> Ratio of spectral power in δ (0.5–4 Hz) to θ (6–10 Hz) for each EEG
channel, based on the work of Costa-Miserachs et al. (2003).
</p>

<p>
<em>EEG4.</em> Spectral power ratios (δ θ)/(β γ) and θ 2 /(δ α) of each EEG channel,
where δ = 1.5– 6 Hz, θ = 6–10 Hz, α = 10.5–15 Hz, β = 22–30 Hz and γ = 35–45
Hz, as published by Louis et al. (2004).
</p>

<p>
The transformation log(x) was applied to each power ratio variable to compress
its dynamic range and make its probability distribution more symmetric.
Algorithmically, we actually used the transformation log(x+ ε) to prevent
numerical errors from taking the log of zero, where ε was chosen as 0.01 times
the 2% smallest ranked non-zero value observed. The log transformation improved
state discrimination for all four EEG variable sets and was therefore uniformly
applied. Note that the variable sets use different frequency ranges to define
the predominant brain rhythms δ, θ, α, β and γ. Many more possible variable
sets are documented in the review by Robert et al. (1999), but a detailed
comparison with and without accelerometer information is beyond the scope of
this work. In some published cases, EMG or EOG was used as an additional
feature (Louis et al., 2004). Finally, the published definitions of the states
classified also varied to some extent but primarily represented SWS, REM and
Awake.

  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h4>Acceleration Variables</h4>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
The accelerometer was incorporated into the head-mounted preamplifier circuitry
(Fig. 1). Its outputs were accelerations A 1 and A 2 in orthogonal directions ê
1 and ê 2 (hat denotes unit vector), where the e 1 e 2 plane is the sagittal
midplane of the rat’s head (Fig. 2). The coordinate direction ê 3 is parallel
to the interaural axis, which connects the ear canals. Both A 1 and A 2 have a
roughly static component due to gravity in addition to a dynamic component due
to motion and vibration. Features representative of different types of motion
behavior were extracted from A 1 and A 2 for state discrimination as follows:
</p>

<p>
<em>ACC0.</em> No accelerometer data was used.
</p>

<p>
<em>ACC1.</em> Total power (1–55 Hz) for each accelerometer channel.
</p>

<p>
<em>ACC2.</em> Power within spectral band limits 1–5 Hz, 5–7 Hz, 7–10 Hz, 10–15 Hz,
15–20 Hz and 20–35 Hz for each accelerometer channel.
</p>

<p>
The log(x) transformation was applied to each acceleration power variable. The
frequency bands used for ACC2 were based on signatures in acceleration power
spectra associated with particular behaviors. Some specific examples, such as
the signature associated with drinking, are discussed below.
</p>

<p>
The orientation of the rat’s head can also be extracted from the measurement of
gravitational acceleration. The vector components of gravity g ⃑ acting along
the accelerometer plane are the static components of A 1 and A 2 (see Fig. 2).
We extract the spherical angles Θ and Φ, which correspond respectively to a
rotation angle about the interaural axis and the angle of the interaural axis
with respect to gravity (lower panel, Fig. 2), by considering the components of
gravity in the plane of the accelerometer, g ⃑ // , and normal to it, g ⃑ ⊥ ,
which are related by:

<p class="caption">
  Eq. 1.
</p>

<p>
We then extract a 1 and a 2 from A 1 and A 2 by lowpass filtering at 1 Hz and
normalizing by g.  Examples of the evolution of Θ and Φ are presented in Fig.
3. Since Θ and Φ are not highly characteristic of behavior when averaged over a
15 s epoch, they were not used for state discrimination.

    <h4>Linear State Discrimination and Statistical Analysis</h4>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Fisher’s multivariate linear discriminant analysis (LDA; see Flury, 1997) was
used to discriminate states for each combination of measured variables. A
geometrical interpretation of Fisher’s methodology and its application to stage
discrimination in the evolution of epileptic seizures from EEG were described
by Schiff et al. (2005). In essence, linear combinations of the variables are
formed that optimally separate clusters of training data points. The linear
discriminant functions establish boundaries—hyperplanes in the feature
space—between the clusters to classify samples into one of many groups.
</p>

<p>
We compared discriminability with and without head acceleration information
based on three metrics of classification error: the leave-one-out error C 0 ,
the leave-half-out error C 1 , and the cross-validation error C 2 . The
leave-one-out error is the average rate of misclassifying a sample point when
it is excluded from the set of points used to construct the linear discriminant
functions. The leave-half-out error C 1 was computed by randomly selecting
one-half of each set of scored points as a training set and then computing the
classification error rate when applying the resulting classifier to the
remaining half. Cross-validation error C 2 estimates the rate of misclassifying
a sample point when using a discriminant function computed from a training set
from another animal. Algorithmically, we computed the classification error rate
C 2 when the same discriminant functions computed for estimating C 1 for one
animal were used to classify the full scored set from the other animal. C 1 and
C 2 were computed by randomly selecting one half the total number of epochs
from each animal as a training set. This procedure was repeated n = 100 times
to estimate the error variability.
</p>

<p>
The statistical significance of each computed value of C 0 was tested with a
bootstrapping method. A likelihood estimate, Wilks’s lambda (Flury, 1997), was
computed for the actual state allocation. Then a surrogate distribution of
lambda was computed using 1000 random reassignments of state labels to the
sample epochs. The significance (p value) of C 0 was determined by the fraction
of surrogates that have a lower value of lambda than the actual one.
</p>

<p>
Since C 0 is expressed as the proportion of misclassified epochs when each is
sequentially excluded from the training set, C 0 values were compared in a
pair-wise manner using a Z-test for difference in proportion. Error comparisons
of C 1 or C 2 for the different combinations of EEG (EEG1–4) and ACC (ACC0–2)
variable sets were made using two-way ANOVA. When p < 0.05, the Tukey-Kramer
(multi-comparison significant differences) test was applied post hoc to
determine which pair-wise differences – for instance, EEG3+ACC0 vs. EEG3+ACC2 –
were significant.
</p>

<p>
This procedure (LDA with error rate analysis) was repeated for classification
of both Sleep- wake state (3 possible states) and Behavioral state (5 possible
states) for all 12 feature sets formed by the possible combinations of EEG
(EEG1–4) and acceleration (ACC0–2) variable sets.

<p>
For each animal, the fraction of epochs in the training set manually scored as
each individual state is recorded in Table I. Not counting Indeterminate
epochs, the rats spent about 60% of the time in sleep, and over 80% of sleep in
SWS. These values compare well with the literature (Gervasoni et al.,
2004;Antle and Mistleberger, 2005) which indicates that this data set is
representative of typical circadian behavior for rats.

    <h3>Motion Signatures of States</h3>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
The animal’s overall activity level was reflected in the total power in the
dynamic acceleration (ACC1). The frequency content, duty cycle and evolution of
the acceleration signals had characteristic signatures for particular
behaviors, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The lapping of water from a tube had a
strong 6 Hz rhythm, especially prominent in the dynamic acceleration A 2 (Fig.
3A). Grooming behavior (Fig. 3B) was often accompanied by high energy bursts at
~10 Hz interrupted every few seconds by the rat tossing its head.
</p>

<p>
Head tosses were captured by changes in head tilt angles Θ and Φ. The quiet
acceleration traces during REM sleep (Fig. 3C) are distinguished from that of
SWS (Fig. 3D) by the observation of occasional brief twitches during REM and
theta (6–8 Hz) rhythm in hippocampal EEG.
</p>

<p>
The temporal sequence of epoch by epoch classified state for a 60 min segment
of training data (240 epochs) is shown in Fig. 4 in the form of a hypnogram
accompanied by spectrograms of depth EEG and head acceleration. Note that
complementary information is contained in the frequency spectra of the EEG and
acceleration signals. For example, theta oscillations during REM and Awake
behavior are very similar, but these states have significantly different
acceleration spectra. These and other observations demonstrate the added
utility of head acceleration measurements and influenced the choice of
frequency bands used to compute acceleration variables ACC2 for use in the LDA.

    <h3>State Discrimination Performance</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
The advantage of including acceleration variables in addition to EEG when using
LDA to distinguish the Sleep-wake state is illustrated in Fig. 5. Here we show
the positions of the points projected in the canonical state space (2
dimensions for 3 states) from discriminants computed both without (5A) and with
(5B) accelerometer information. When accelerometer information is included
(Fig. 5B) the different states fall into tighter clusters that have much less
overlap.  Especially notice that the REM and Awake cluster centers are further
apart when acceleration is included (5B).
</p>

<p>
We present the LDA classification errors for Sleep-wake state and Behavioral
state discrimination for Rat I in Fig. 6 and for Rat II in Fig. 7.
</p>

  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h4>Sleep-wake state (Figs. 6 and 7, Top Row)</h4>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
In the discrimination of Sleep-wake state (SWS, REM, Awake), the values of the
leave-one-out error C 0 were all individually found to be significant (p <
0.05). Comparisons of discrimination between variable sets yielded the
following results: Without acceleration variables (ACC0), the leave-one-out
error C 0 averaged over all EEG sets was 12.3% for Rat I and 13.0% for Rat II
(n = 4). When acceleration variables were included, C 0 dropped significantly
(p < 0.05) to a mean of 5.2% for Rat I and 2.3% for Rat II with ACC1 and 4.7%
for Rat I and 2.0% for Rat II with ACC2. Although the errors were lower for
ACC2 than with ACC1, the differences between these were not significant.
</p>

<p>
The “leave-half-out” error, C 1 , was in the same range as C 0 . Effects of
ACC1 and ACC2 followed the same trend as for C 0 . In each case, both EEG+ACC1
and EEG+ACC2 were significantly lower than EEG+ACC0 (p < 0.05). The C 1 error
for EEG+ACC2 was lower than for EEG+ACC1 but the difference was not
statistically significant except with EEG2 for Rat II.
</p>

<p>
When classification was done with EEG variables alone (ACC0), the cross-animal
classification error C 2 was quite high compared to C 1 , but inclusion of
accelerometer information significantly decreased the error rates.
Specifically, inclusion of ACC1 reduced C 2 by more than half of its value with
ACC0 (p < 0.05). In some instances (EEG1 and EEG3 for Rat I, EEG2 for Rat II),
ACC2 further significantly reduced C 2 (p < 0.05) relative to ACC1 (Figs. 6 and
7, Top).
</p>

<p>
In summary, when using LDA to differentiate SWS, REM and Awake states, the
inclusion of accelerometer data always significantly reduced all error rates
compared to using EEG alone.  In addition, ACC2 sometimes performed
significantly better than ACC1, especially during cross-validation.
</p>

    <h4>Behavioral state (Figs. 6 and 7, Bottom row)</h4>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
For Behavioral state (SWS, REM, QW, FG, EXP) discrimination the average
leave-one-out error C 0 using EEG variables alone (ACC0) was higher than for
Sleep-wake state. The addition of ACC1 reduced C 0 significantly (p < 0.05)
with EEG3 and EEG4 for Rat I, and with any variable set for Rat II.
Discrimination with ACC2 was always significantly (p < 0.05) better (lower C 0
) than ACC0.
</p>

<p>
For EEG+ACC0, C 1 was about 25–40%. ACC1 reduced the error significantly (p <
0.05) by about 10%. Inclusion of ACC2 enabled a further significant reduction
(p < 0.05) compared to ACC1 of about 2%.
</p>

<p>
The cross-animal discrimination error C 2 computed using only EEG variables was
35% or larger. The use of acceleration variables ACC1 or ACC2 reduced the error
significantly (p < 0.05), though the resulting error was still above 25%.
</p>

<p>
Comparisons between the choices of EEG variables 1–4 sometimes gave significant
differences (p < 0.05), but the differences are tangential to the main goals of
this study, which are to investigate the utility of acceleration measurements
to improve the accuracy of automatic sleep- wake and behavioral state
discrimination. The performance of a particular choice of EEG variables may
vary depending on the data set and conditions of the recording. For these
reasons, we do not comment further on comparisons of EEG feature sets.

    <h3>EEG-Based State Discrimination is Sensitive to Variable Selection</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Sleep-wake staging in animals is often conducted using signals from cortex
alone (Robert et al., 1999). We repeated the discrimination analysis excluding
the two hippocampal signals. To compare state discrimination from cortical EEG
with and without accelerometer variables, we computed the leave-one-out
discrimination error C 0 . We found that when using cortical EEG alone, C 0 was
higher (average error for EEG1–4, Sleep-Wake: 25.5% for Rat I, 26.5% for Rat
II; Behavior: 34.8% for Rat I, 39.0% for Rat II) than when hippocampal EEG was
included.  However, including acceleration variables again significantly
reduced C 0 (average error for EEG1–4, Sleep-Wake: 7.1% for Rat I, 2.3% for Rat
II; Behavior: 23.6% for Rat I, 23.3% for Rat II). When accelerometer variables
were included with EEG, the error rates for inclusion and exclusion of
hippocampal signals were not significantly different.
</p>

<p>
The variability in error, especially when classification is done out-of-sample,
is a major concern for automatic sleep staging systems. Scaling of the
variables—as done in each of the four chosen methods—reduces their
vulnerability to changes in background signal power. In their analysis,
Gervasoni et al. (2004) also reduced the number of variables by taking the
first principal component of each scaled variable over all available channels,
which they report accounted for over 80% of the variability in their data. They
then classified states based on cluster analysis within this reduced dimension
feature space.
</p>

<p>
Principal component analysis orients and ranks the axes along the directions of
greatest variability in the data but not necessarily the directions of greatest
differences between groups to be discriminated. In contrast, Fisher
discriminant analysis orients and ranks axes in the data along directions that
optimally separate the groups. Therefore, reducing dimensions or variables
prior to finding those optimal directions can be counterproductive to LDA. We
illustrate this effect in Fig. 8 by presenting the fractional changes in error
rates for LDA based on variable set EEG2+ACC0 after different amounts of
principal component dimension reduction. In each case, we have computed the
principal components for each scaled variable over the four available channels,
and reduced the dimension of the data input into the LDA to its projection
along the first N largest principal components. Retaining all principal
components is equivalent to rotation without dimension reduction. Only when
most or all of the principal components are included does the performance reach
that found without dimension reduction.

    <h3>Automatic Staging for Chronic Recordings</h3>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
The LDA behavioral state classifier using EEG1+ACC2 variables was trained on
the scored data and then applied to automatically stage ~3 days of recording
each from rats I and II (total of 130 h). The overall state probabilities and
state transition probabilities were computed for the chronic recordings and
used to construct the transition map shown in Fig. 9. No attempt was made to
distinguish intermediate or transitional states; these were classified as the
most similar Behavioral state on the LDA feature space.
</p>

<p>
Comparisons between properties of the behavioral state transition map generated
by LDA classification of extended data sets and the literature are favorable,
and confirm that this approach is likely to be reliable enough for automated
application.
</p>

<p>
The relative probabilities of Sleep-wake states are comparable to those
reported in the literature (Robert et al., 1999; Costa-Miserachs et al., 2003;
Gervasoni et al., 2004; Antle and Mistlberger, 2005). Probabilities of
different awake behavioral states are not commonly reported, and when they are,
the definitions of the states vary (Robert et al., 2003). Therefore,
comparisons of behavioral state probabilities are difficult.
</p>

<p>
Only one report quantifying state transition probabilities was available
(Gervasoni et al., 2004). The FG state was grouped along with QW to make a
direct comparison possible. The predominant transitions (SWS to REM and QW, REM
to SWS and QW, QW to SWS and EXP, and EXP to QW) and their probabilities for
rats I and II were similar to those in Gervasoni et al. (2004), except that in
their findings REM transitioned almost exclusively to QW and never back to SWS.
In contrast, our results included transitions from REM to both SWS and QW with
comparable frequency. Sleep sequences involving repeated cycling between REM
and SWS have also been documented by others (Piscopo et al., 2001).
</p>

<p>
In a stochastic modeling study Gregory and Cabeza (2002) report that the
distributions of REM episode durations and inter-REM episode waiting times for
male Sprague-Dawley rats appeared to be bimodal in shape, with modal means of
18.6 s and 101.5 s for REM duration and 80–140 s and 400–700 s for inter-REM
waiting times. Other estimates of average REM duration are ~23 s (Renger et
al., 2004), 21±2 s (Shinomiya et al., 2004) and ~1–2 min (Tiba et al., 2003);
the distributions were not specified. Although our 15 s epoch durations do not
allow us to compare directly with the REM duration distribution of Gregory and
Cabeza (2002), we find a mean REM duration of 55±2 s (median = 30 s), and a
mean inter-REM waiting time of 314±13 s (median = 195 s), with distributions
that could be bimodal.

  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
We have demonstrated that the addition of head acceleration measurements to EEG
spectral measurements significantly improves LDA use to automatically classify
Sleep-wake and Behavioral state. With EEG alone, we observed wide variability
in discrimination performance based on the set of EEG variables used
(Costa-Miserachs et al., 2003; Gervasoni et al., 2004; Louis et al., 2004;
Sunderam et al., 2005). The addition of acceleration improved and equalized
their performance, and rendered the choice of EEG variables less critical.
</p>

<p>
In sleep-wake studies, the prominence of the theta rhythm both in REM sleep and
during active awake behavior makes discrimination between these states
difficult with EEG alone (Fig. 4).  Although there are instances of EEG being
used unaided for state discrimination (e.g., Gervasoni et al., 2004), auxiliary
measurements of muscular (EMG) and ocular (EOG) activity are typically used to
help differentiate these states (see review by Robert et al., 1999).
</p>

<p>
The advantage of using head acceleration over EMG or EOG is that it can be done
noninvasively. Mundl and Malmo (1979) appear to have been the first to record
head movements in animals using a custom-made movement transducer based on a
weighted phono- stylus. Accelerometers have been used before to characterize
behavior, either fixed to the base of the animal enclosure (Swerdlow et al.,
1998) or strapped to the animal’s body (Hernandez- Gonzalez et al., 1997).
Thus, accelerometers have been successfully used in the study of diverse
behaviors, but the measurements reflected only the relative amplitude or
pattern of motion.  Modern MEMS accelerometers, which are inexpensive and have
high sensitivity, can be integrated onto a single circuit with the head-mounted
EEG recording preamplifiers or into the cable connector to the EEG electrodes,
at the cost of approximately 0.3 cm 2 surface area and 0.15 g. In our work, the
DC acceleration sensitivity of the MEMS device gives static as well as dynamic
acceleration. As we have shown above, the output can be conveniently processed
to give accurate and instantaneous estimates of spatial orientation and
acceleration. These capabilities can be employed to quantify motion and
behavior more accurately than was previously possible.
</p>

<p>
In many state classification studies, time consuming human expert evaluation
and validation of video records is required. Real-time video tracking of
behavior using image processing is feasible but more computation-intensive than
one-dimensional measurements such as acceleration. Discrimination of abnormal
motor behavior during neonatal seizures (Karayiannis et al., 2005) and the
presence of muscle tone during REM sleep behavior disorder (Mahowald and
Schenck, 2005) are examples of clinical applications where continuous video
tracking has been useful. To detect and study these conditions, continuous,
real-time (30 Hz) video measurements for hours or days are required.
Acceleration measurements are increasingly being used to detect potentially
interesting behavior for retrospective video analysis and quantification in
human motion studies (Garnier and Benefice, 2006; Hon et al., 2006).
</p>

<p>
In our results, including acceleration variables ACC1 or ACC2 always resulted
in improved classification error over ACC0, but the improvement with ACC2 when
compared to ACC1 was often not significant (28 of 48 comparisons in Figs. 6 and
7). It is well known that the variability in expert scoring of vigilance state
is typically 5–10% (Costa-Miserachs et al., 2003;Louis et al., 2004),
especially with the ambiguity inherent in classifying single states for 15 s
long epochs. Since discrimination with ACC1 is already within the margin of
inter-scorer reliability for several cases shown in Figs. 6 and 7, it is
unlikely to be improved upon significantly by including ACC2.
</p>

<p>
Comparing Sleep-wake and Behavioral states, the classification error is greater
by an order of magnitude for the latter. This is not simply an effect of the
greater number of states to be classified (five versus three) as the error per
state is still larger for Behavioral state. The discrepancy is resolved by
examining the confusion matrix presented in Table II, which tabulates the
errors from classified and actual states when using the LDA with EEG1+ACC2.
While SWS and REM are classified with the same high accuracy (> 90%) whether
Sleep-Wake or Behavioral states are considered, the sub-classification of awake
behavior is relatively poor.  FG is misclassified as QW or EXP about 40% of the
time. Likewise, QW is often wrongly classified as EXP or FG. It appears that an
important source of this error is the limited epoch resolution of 15 s. A
particular behavior was scored as FG or EXP if it occurred at any time during
an epoch, however brief the duration of the activity, and without regard to its
vigor.  When the power associated with this activity is averaged over 15 s, its
magnitude is diluted and less distinguishable from QW. In addition, multiple
behaviors can occur in the same 15 s epoch (e.g., FG followed by EXP), in which
case the one with the longest duration in the epoch was used to assign a
Behavior score.
</p>

<p>
We used in this study fixed 15 s epochs to benchmark LDA with accelerometer
information against previous work on behavioral staging. The chosen epoch
duration of 15 s makes proper evaluation of classifier performance with and
without acceleration variables—the primary objective of this study—feasible
using reliable visual scores.
</p>

<p>
We are now implementing these methods for real time use with better
time-frequency descriptors, finer grained temporal delimiting of motion, and
adaptive learning, to detect both state and state transitions. Since we have
shown that the cross-animal validation error is significantly improved by the
use of accelerometer variables, an adaptive learning system can use
discriminant functions established on other animals as an initial condition for
state discrimination.

<p>
We have shown significant improvement in state discrimination accuracy afforded
by the addition of acceleration measurements to EEG. MEMS accelerometers are
lightweight (0.15 gram) and inexpensive, less invasive than EMG or EOG, and the
modifications in circuitry over that required for EEG acquisition are minimal.
We intend to use this improved behavioral state detection capability to
formulate and inform detection and feedback control algorithms for treating
seizures.

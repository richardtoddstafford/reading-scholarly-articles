Subcontinent, 1784-1838." Journal of the Early Republic 33, no. 3 (2013):
397-431.  Scholarship by historians is primary communicated via monographs
however there are several significant journals published to promote
scholarly communication through the dissemination of information relevant
to scope of the publication.  Typically, these publications are associated
with a particular professional association. For historians, two of the most
important professional associations are the American Historical Association
and the Organization of American Historians, but there are also specialized
associations who focus on specific geographical or topical areas. For
instance, the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic
publishes the journal in which the example article is published. The
governing administration of the association establishes guidelines and
publishing standards carried out by an editorial body that oversees the
production of the publication.

Historians generally construct a research question that explores change
over time of an issue, event, or location. They construct their research
questions very carefully and are generally answer these questions using a
pool of primary sources.  Primary sources provide historians with their
principal form of evidence by offering substantiation for the claims made
by the scholar. In historical practice, primary source are understood to be
direct evidence from a particular time period.  Historians also rely
heavily on the work of previous scholars. These secondary sources fill in
gaps and provides more context for reader. Further, the synthesis of
primary and secondary sources allows the author to demonstrate the
significance of their work to the field.

When historians have an article they want to submit they can look for a
journal that falls within the scope of their work and examine the
submission requirements.  This information often includes a length
requirement as well as format standards.  Typically, journals specify their
citation standards in these requirements; in History, the most common
citation standard is the Chicago Manual of Style footnote style.  Some
journals have an extensive peer review process but others rely primarily on
their editorial staff to review submissions. For those journals with a peer
review process, submitted articles are generally sent anonymously to two to
three expert readers, who typically approve for publishing, ask the author
to revise and re- submit for consideration, or reject the submission.In
addition, journals provide information that describes their governance,
scope and general information regarding the extent of their circulation.
Journals also provide information for those that want to subscribe and what
databases provide access to their content.

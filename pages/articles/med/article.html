    <h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
<strong>Background:</strong> The role of a low glycemic index (GI) diet in the
management of adolescent obesity remains controversial.  In this study, we aim
to evaluate the impact of low GI diet versus a conventional Chinese diet on the
body mass index (BMI) and other obesity indices of obese adolescents.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Methods:</strong> Obese adolescents aged 15–18 years were identified
from population-recruited, territory-wide surveys.  Obesity was defined as BMI
≥95th percentile of Hong Kong local age- and sex-specific references. Eligible
subjects were randomized to either an intervention with low GI diet (consisting
of 45-50% carbohydrate, 30-35% fat and 15-20% protein) or conventional Chinese
diet as control (consisting of 55-60% carbohydrate, 25-30% fat and 10-15%
protein).  We used random intercept mixed effects model to compare the
differential changes across the time points from baseline to month 6 between
the 2 groups.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Results:</strong> 104 obese adolescents were recruited (52 in low GI
group and 52 in control group; 43.3% boys). Mean age was 16.7 ± 1.0 years and
16.8 ±1.0 years in low GI and control group respectively. 58.7% subjects
completed the study at 6 months (65.4% in low GI group and 51.9% in control
group). After adjustment for age and sex, subjects in the low GI group had a
significantly greater reduction in obesity indices including BMI, body weight
and waist circumference (WC) compared to subjects in the control group (all p
<0.05). After further adjustment for physical activity levels, WC was found to
be significantly lower in the low GI group compared to the conventional group
(p = 0.018).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Low GI diet in the context of a comprehensive
lifestyle modification program may be an alternative to conventional diet in
the management of obese adolescents.

    <h2>Background</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Obesity is a prevalent condition in both the adult and in the adolescent
population. The prevalence and severity of obesity in both children and in
adolescents are in- creasing worldwide [1,2] and there is substantial tracking
of childhood overweight/obesity into adulthood [3]. It is evident that
childhood obesity is not a benign condition and is associated with clustering
of cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities [4-6]. Most worrying is the
lack of effective therapies in the management of child- hood obesity.
Conventional weight management pro- grams have focused on restricting energy
consumption and limiting fat and/or carbohydrate intake. However, the
effectiveness of these conventional dietary ap- proaches for children and
adolescents are only modest and inconclusive due to the small number of trials
and their short-term nature [7,8]. There is growing evidence showing that when
access to palatable food is restricted, this will promote the tendency to
overeat when these food become freely available [9]. The emphasis of low fat
diet may theoretically increase glycemic index (GI), which has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [10,11].
</p>

<p>
Emerging evidence suggests that low GI diet may be more efficacious than an
energy-restricted, low fat diet in reducing body weight [12-14]. Against this
back- ground, we conducted this randomized controlled trial aiming to study the
changes in obesity indices in obese adolescents randomized to low GI diet
versus a conven- tional Chinese diet as control.

    <h3>Study population and assessments</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
The study commenced in February 2010 and each sub- ject was followed up for 18
months consisting of a 12- month interventional period followed by a 6-month
observational period. This is the interim analysis of the data at 6-months for
this ongoing study. This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics
Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants as well as from their parents’ or guardians’
prior to recruitment into the study.
</p>

<p>
Obese adolescents were identified from territory-wide, population-recruited
surveys [2,4,15]. All participants from the surveys were healthy volunteers
with no major medical illnesses and not on any chronic medications.  Obesity
was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥95th percentile of local age- and
sex-specific references [16].  Eligible subjects were randomized to 2 groups:
low GI diet versus conventional Chinese diet. Randomization were carried out
using computer-generated random numbers, sealed in opaque envelopes and in
blocks of 6 further stratified by gender. Treatment assignment was done by an
independent personnel who opened the en- velopes with consecutive numbers for
the allocation of treatment of eligible subjects. All participants underwent a
comprehensive assessment including anthropometric measurements, clinical
examinations by endocrinologists and questionnaires documenting food frequency
and 3- day diet record using locally validated questionnaires [17], as well as
physical activity levels using a locally vali- dated Chinese version of
International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) [18]. The scoring
protocol for physical activity level was downloaded from IPAQ offi- cial
website (http://www.ipaq.ki.se/scoring.htm). Resting energy expenditure was
measured by indirect calorim- etry using MedGem® (Microlife Medical Home
Solutions Inc., United States). Body fat percentage was assessed by
bioimpedence (Tanita physician digital scale, model number TBF 410, Tanita
Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
</p>

<p>
After an overnight fast of 8–10 hours, blood samples were collected for
measurement of fasting glucose and lipid profile including total cholesterol
(TC), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
levels. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated using
the Friedewald’s formula for TG < 4.5 mmol/l [19]. An oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT) was performed with the administration of 1.75 g of glu- cose per
kilogram of body weight with maximal dose of 75 g. Diabetes was diagnosed if
fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L and/or 2 hour plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L
[20]. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was diagnosed if fast- ing plasma glucose
was 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and impaired glu- cose tolerance (IGT) was diagnosed if 2
hour plasma glucose was 7.8-11.0 mmol/L [20]. Laboratory assess- ments were all
repeated at 6 months.

    <h3>Interventions</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Subjects allocated to the low GI group were counselled by a dietitian at week
0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and thereafter at 8-week intervals, for a total of 7 sessions
during the 6-month intervention period. Each session lasted approximately 30
minutes on an individual basis. Parents of the subject were encouraged to join
the counselling sessions. The intervention was based on a strategy of
increasing energy expenditure and reducing caloric intake using lifestyle
behavioral change to achieve long-lasting impact. The dietitian completed a
tracking form and progress note after each counselling session to document
patterns of dietary intake. Three-day diet record which included two weekdays
and a weekend day as reported by the partici- pants prior to the consultation
visits, were reviewed by the dietitian with appropriate advice given. Physical
activ- ity levels were measured by self-administered, validated questionnaires
[18,21].
</p>

<p>
In the first session (about 1 hour) (week 0), the dietitian carried out a
complete behavioral assessment covering the participant’s current eating and
lifestyle patterns, nutri- tional knowledge, and feelings about lifestyle
changes. The dietitian discussed with the participants the expected dur- ation
and specific dietary and lifestyle advice required to achieve a desirable
weight status (<85th percentile of the local age- and sex-specific reference)
[16]. The dietitian prescribed an individualized menu plan with 20% caloric
restriction based on his/her current diet. The dietitian would also consider
the daily nutritional requirement of the participant based on the
recommendations of the American Dietetic Association [22]. A balanced diet with
an emphasis on fruit and vegetables, and low-fat, low-GI and low-calorific
products in appropriate portions was en- couraged. Low caloric products are
those equal to or less than 100 kcal per serving, and the fat and sugar content
should also be equal to or less than 5 gm and 30% of the total calorie
respectively. Practical tips were given based on behavioral principles
including goal setting, knowledge acquisition, problem solving, feedback and
reinforcement.  Participants and their families were educated on the bene- fits
of a low GI diet. Each participant received two booklets, one for food portion
size exchange and tips for eating out, and another listing the low GI food
options and meal plans (GI <55) [23]. Consumption of low GI food, use of
healthy fat, and avoidance of high GI food based on the low GI pyramid [24]
were emphasized. Par- ticipants were encouraged to have at least one low-GI
food per meal. Participants and their families were taught how to read food
labels to ensure balanced intake. The targeted proportion of energy from
carbohydrate and fat were 45-50% and 30-35%, respectively, with the rest com-
ing from protein.
</p>

<p>
In the follow-up sessions (lasting for about 20 mi- nutes), the dietitian
reviewed the participant’s compli- ance to diet as well as his/her progress by
reviewing the dietary record to ensure adequate nutritional calories in the
diet and provide appropriate recommendations on the dietary plan. Besides
reviewing the participant’s com- pliance to the diet, the dietitian encouraged
the partici- pants to share any personal and environmental barriers to
lifestyle change. The dietitian also assessed the partic- ipant’s feelings
towards the dietary advice and to the progress made. Ongoing support and
encouragement was provided to the participants, with target goals re- defined
based on the participant’s feelings and progress, and the participant’s efforts
and achievements was ac- knowledged to enhance their self-efficacy.
Participants were encouraged to perform aerobic exercise ≥3 days of 30 minutes
a week. Motivational telephone calls (10– 15 minutes) were made 5 times during
the 6-month period to remind them to adhere to the assigned diet and to address
their queries on food choices.
</p>

<p>
In order to standardize the dietary advice in the con- trol group, the
conventional Chinese diet were based on the standard food pyramid promoted by
the Hong Kong Department of Health with advice on daily proportion of
carbohydrate, fat and protein without information about low GI diet [25]. The
targeted proportion of energy from carbohydrate and fat were 55-60% and 25-30%,
respect- ively, with the rest coming from protein. The conven- tional Chinese
diet was presumed to be a high GI diet (≥70) based on several local studies
showing that refined grains, especially Jasmine rice from Thailand with a GI
value of 109 were commonly consumed among Hong Kong Chinese children and their
adult counterparts [26].  Control group was counselled by a research nurse dur-
ing the intervention period. Dietary advice was based on the dietary
recommendation of the standard food pyra- mid, with emphasis on reducing energy
intake by limit- ing dietary fat intake and high caloric foods [25].
</p>

<p>
The contact time, both individual counseling and tele- phone reinforcement, and
the dietary assessment methods were the same for participants randomized to the
control group and to the low GI group. Subject participation was evaluated on
the basis of session attendance, and adherence to dietary advice was assessed
by means of the 3-day diet record.

  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Daily nutritional intake and food consumption at base- line and 6 months for
participants of both groups were assessed using a three-day diet record.
Participants were asked to provide detailed descriptions of foods and bev-
erages consumed. Common household measures such as cups, bowls, teaspoons and
tablespoons, etc., as well as a food photo album consisting of common food
items were used to quantify food intake. Daily nutritional in- take and food
consumption at baseline and 6 months were calculated by the nutrition analysis
software Food Processor Nutrition analysis and Fitness software version 8.0
(ESHA Research, Salem, USA) including local foods selected from food
composition tables from China and Hong Kong [27,28]. Dietary values of GL and
glycemic load (GL) of the participants were estimated using a Food Frequency
Questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and 6 months [17]. Each participant was asked
to complete the questionnaire – the food item, the size of each portion, the
number of times of consumption each day and each week, using the past six
months prior to the interview as a reference period. Portion size was explained
to partici- pants using a catalogue of pictures of individual food portions.
The GI of each individual food based on the glucose reference in the FFQ were
assigned according to published values obtained from the international table of
GI and GL values of foods [29], the China Food Com- position Table [27], one
Hong Kong paper [30], as well as from database from Sydney [31]. When a
published value was not available, the composition of the food was
systematically evaluated to impute a GI value. The diet- ary GI for each
participant was calculated by summing the products of the percentage
contribution of each indi- vidual food to daily available carbohydrate intake
multi- plied by the food’s GI value. Available carbohydrate was calculated as
total carbohydrate minus dietary fiber [32].  The dietary GL was also
calculated by multiplying the dietary GI by the total amount of daily available
carbo- hydrate intake (divided by 100).

Data were summarized and presented using appropriate statistics; mean (standard
deviation), median (inter-quartile range) and frequency (percentage) for
normal-like, skewed and categorical variables respectively. Visceral fat was
log- transformed to correct for its skewness before being entered for
statistical analysis. Baseline characteristics be- tween the two arms of
subjects were compared using Student’s t test or chi-square test, as
appropriate. All the outcome variables were analysed on the basis of the
intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Random intercept mixed effects model was
used to compare the differential changes on various outcome measures of obesity
indices and cardiometabolic risk factors (BMI, obesity indices and
cardiometabolic risk factors were primary, secondary and tertiary outcome
measures respectively) across the time points at month 0 (baseline) and month 6
between the two arms with adjustment for age and sex. In particular, the
interaction terms group*time was included in the mixed effects model to assess
the difference in change of each of the outcomes across month 0 and month 6 be-
tween the two arms. Mixed effects model can account for intra-correlated
repeated measures data and accommodate missing data due to incomplete visits or
subjects who have dropped-out, provided the data are missing at random [33],
and thus is particularly suitable for intention-to-treat analysis without the
need of imputation for missing data.  The mixed effects models were analysed
using the PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, release 9.3). Other statis-
tical analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All
statistical tests involved were two-sided and a p-value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

104 obese adolescents were recruited in this study (52 in the low GI group and
52 in the control group; 43.3% boys; mean age 16.8 ± 1.0 years; mean BMI 30.9 ±
3.9 kg/m 2 ).  Table 1 shows the baseline clinical and biochemical char-
acteristics of the study cohort. Obesity indices between adolescents in the
control and low GI groups were similar except adolescents in control group were
less centrally obese and tended to have lower body fat compared to the low GI
group [waist circumference and body fat percent- age of the control and low GI
group were 92.3 ± 9.8 and 96.5 ± 10.9 cm (p = 0.043), and 36.8 ± 8.3 and 39.8 ±
10.9% (p = 0.051) respectively]. All other clinical and biochemical
characteristics of the study subjects in both groups were comparable (all p >
0.05). None of them had diabetes or impaired fasting glucose at baseline, but
14% of them had impaired glucose tolerance (Table 1). 58.7% subjects com-
pleted 6 month study (65.4% in low GI group and 51.9% in control group).
</p>

<p>
Table 2 shows the daily dietary intake of macronutri- ents and fiber, resting
energy expenditure and physical activity level of the study subjects at
baseline and 6 months of the study. There was no significant differ- ence in
daily nutrient intakes, resting energy expenditure and physical activity level
between the two groups at baseline. At 6 months, adolescents in the low GI
group had significantly lower total daily energy intake, less fat intake, and
more protein and fiber intake in their diet (all p < 0.05) compared to
adolescents in the control group (Table 2). However, we could not find a
significant difference in GI and glycemic load (GL) between the two groups from
baseline to month 6 (Table 2).
</p>

<p>
Table 3 shows the obesity indices and other cardiomet- abolic risk factors
including blood pressure, lipid profile, indices of glycemia and albuminuria of
the subjects at baseline and 6-month in both groups. After adjustment for age
and sex, subjects in the low GI group had signifi- cant reduction in obesity
indices including BMI, body weight and waist circumference compared to subjects
in the control group (all p < 0.05) (Table 4). After adjust- ment for age, sex
and physical activity, waist circumfer- ence remained significantly lower in
the low GI group compared to that in the conventional group after 6 months of
intervention (p = 0.018) (Table 5). We did not find any significant differences
in body fat percentage (total, truncal and visceral fat percentage) as assessed
by bioimpedence at baseline and across month 6 of the study (Tables 4 and 5).
We also did not find any significant changes across baseline and month 6 for
other cardiomet- abolic risk factors including blood pressure, LDL-
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour
plasma glucose and glucose changes dur- ing OGTT (as measured by area under
curve of OGTT) (data not shown).

  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
There is a paucity of data in dietary intervention studies examining the impact
of low GI diet in obese adoles- cents. To date, there has only been one
published study from Europe (the Diogenes Project) of a 6-month inter- vention
[34] which had a total of 5 intervention arms (low protein/low GI, low
protein/high GI, high protein/ low GI, high protein/high GI and control diet).
It con- cluded that neither GI nor protein had an isolated effect on body
composition. Nonetheless, the low protein and high GI combination increased
body fat while the high protein and low GI diet was protective against obesity
in children. Our present study is novel in being the largest randomized
controlled trial with a reasonable duration of intervention, having low GI diet
as the only interven- tion arm [35]. Moreover, all the participants were of
Chinese ethnicity and our study included the measure- ments of resting energy
expenditure and physical activity levels, which were not included in the work
reported by Papadaki and co-workers [34]. We found that obese adolescents had
significantly greater reduction in obesity indices after 6 months of
intervention with low GI diet- ary counseling compared to those in the control
group.  The obese adolescents in the low GI group also had less total energy
intake and a healthier diet with greater daily dietary fiber and protein
intake, and less fat intake. How- ever, despite the fact that the low GI group
had greater daily dietary intake of fiber and less carbohydrate, we could not
show a significant difference in GI and GL be- tween the two groups from
baseline to month 6. There are a number of possible explanations for this lack
of differences of GI and GL between the two groups at baseline and after 6
months. First, it might be possible that the study subjects randomized to low
GI diet did not comply satisfactorily to the prescribed diet. From our
observation, most participants in the intervention group did not include at
least one low GI food per meal.  Only some of them were able to replace high GI
food items with low GI ones, such as white rice with brown or red rice, white
bread with whole wheat bread, or classic coke with diet coke. Second, the
energy and mac- ronutrients, including energy, carbohydrate, fat and protein
were estimated by 3-day record which was con- sidered more accurate in
capturing current energy and macronutrient intakes. However, the GI and GL
values from diet were estimated by a food frequency question- naire (FFQ). FFQ
had only been validated for quantifying common nutrient intakes but had not
been validated for estimating dietary GI and GL values. Third, many Chinese
food do not have GI values and were actually difficult to provide GI values,
such as Dim Sum. The GI values from diets of the study subjects in this present
trial were estimated mainly from the GI values of inter- national published
data which might account for some bias in the accurate estimation of GI values
of Chinese food.
</p>

<p>
Conventional weight management programs have fo- cused on restricting energy
consumption and limiting fat and/or carbohydrate intake. However, the
effectiveness of these conventional dietary approaches for children and
adolescents are only modest and inconclusive due to the limited number of
trials, small number of subjects in the trials and their short-term nature
[7,8,35]. Besides, high attrition rates, lack of assessment of adherence to
treatment protocols and unequal intensity of intervention across intervention
arms are important limitations for many dietary intervention trials and
possibly account for the inconsistent results reported among different studies
[24,36,37]. There is indeed a stark need to search for ef- fective nutritional
management in obese adolescents.
</p>

<p>
Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies from the East and West show
that dietary GI may play a protective role in reducing the risks of chronic
diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart diseases
[10,11,35]. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of
low GI are not fully understood, it is plausible that low GI food work through
reducing satiety and attenuating pancreatic in- sulin responses
post-prandially. In energy homeostasis, multiple hormones with metabolic and
haemodynamic effects are involved in the brain-gut-pancreas-liver axis [35].
Habitual consumption of high GI diet will initiate a sequence of metabolic and
neurohormonal events that can stimulate hunger, promote fat deposition,
increase insulin secretion, thereby putting the pancreatic beta cells under
chronic stress resulting in early onset of type 2 diabetes [35,38], especially
in the presence of other risk factors such as genetic variants [39]. In rat
models, high GI food have been shown to increase post-prandial rise in plasma
glucose and insulin levels, increase plasma trigly- ceride concentrations,
decrease adiponectin levels, in- crease body fat and decrease lean body mass
[38]. In human studies, intake of low GI food has also been shown to increase
lean body mass, cause greater weight loss and less inflammatory activation
compared to high GI diet [38,40]. In overweight or obese adults, consumption of
low GI food is associated with increased resting energy ex- penditure,
decreased plasma free fatty acids levels, re- duced fat oxidation, improved
lipid profile and increased satiety [38,40,41].
</p>

<p>
An interesting observation in this study is that 0 out of 104 obese adolescents
had abnormal fasting plasma glucose levels at baseline. Nonetheless, 14% of the
par- ticipants had impaired glucose tolerance which was detected only by OGTT.
First phase insulin secretion and post-prandial hyperglycemia are early signs
of dia- betes in people from Asia. This highlights the import- ance of
performing OGTT in at-risk individuals, such as those with obesity and of Asian
ethnicity.
</p>

<p>
Our present study has the strength of close monitoring to treatment protocols
adherence by regular telephone reminders and equal intervention across the 2
arms.  There were equal contact times, counseling and tele- phone
reinforcement, as well as the dietary assessment methods for the participants
in both the control group and the low GI group. We had measurements of energy
expenditure by using indirect calorimetry and IPAQ which were lacking in the
European trial reported by Papadaki [34]. There are several limitations which
need to be addressed in this study. First, we used dietary questionnaires to
assess macronutrients of the study subjects before, during and after
intervention. Due to the fact that self-reported dietary intake measures is a
common research limitation, there has been increasing use of dietary biomarkers
for research in the field of nu- trition [42]. Of note, this was not only a
low-GI inter- vention, since there were other intervention components as well
(e.g. weight loss). Compared to the DiOGenes study which involved an ad libitum
energy intake [34], the present study was a weight loss study promoting a
low-GI diet. Therefore, it might be difficult to distin- guish whether the
effects observed were due to the low- GI advice provided or the reduction in
energy intake that was promoted. Second, our study had high attrition rate with
only 59% subjects completing the study at 6 months despite our research team’s
efforts in giving telephone reminders and reinforcement, which was in- deed
comparable to the attrition rate reported by the only published 6-month dietary
intervention including low GI diet in obese adolescents [34]. The high drop-out
rate is a common phenomenon in dietary interventions and particularly a
challenge for dietary trials in adolescents who are free of any symptoms and
with multiple compet- ing commitments such as school work and social activ-
ities. For the dietary intervention done by the same group of researchers
(Diet, Obesity and Genes, Diogenes, Pro- ject), 58.1% adolescents completed 6
months dietary inter- vention [34] while 71% adults completed the 6-month trial
[43]. Third, our study captures outcome measures at 6 months which may be too
short to detect any significant change in lipid profile and glucose
intolerance. Moreover, the planned sample size for this ongoing study would be
140 subjects per study arm based on the meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials including both adults and ad- olescents studies that assessed the
effects of low GI diet versus high GI or other diets for change in body mass
index [40], the data may be under-powered to detect changes in cardiometabolic
risk factors. These factors may account for our negative findings of any
differences in gly- cemia and lipid profile between participants in the control
and the low GI group. Longer duration of intervention would provide more
information in this regard. Fourth, we did not document the data on the
compliance to the dietary requirements of low GI diet or American Diabetes
Association conventional diet. Nonetheless, in each coun- seling session, the
dietitian did review the dietary records and provided recommendations
accordingly.

<p>
In conclusion, this 6-month dietary intervention trial re- sults in significant
reduction in obesity indices in obese adolescents when compared to conventional
diet. The 6- month intervention resulted in decreased calorie intake and a
healthier dietary composition in terms of in- creased fiber intake and reduced
fat intake in obese ado- lescents. Our results and others suggest that apart
from its quantity, the quality of carbohydrate content in a meal may be an
essential element in obesity manage- ment with health implications [44]. A low
GI diet may be an alternative to conventional approach in dietary management of
obese adolescents and the importance of a comprehensive lifestyle modification
program cannot be over-emphasized in obesity management. A longer duration
randomized controlled dietary trial is ongoing and will provide more
information regarding the longer term effects of low GI diet on other metabolic
profiles.

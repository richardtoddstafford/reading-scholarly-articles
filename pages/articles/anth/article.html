    <h3>Abstract</h3>

<p><em>
Educational reformers and social observers call for increasing community in
our schools and neighborhoods. In that discourse, community appears as a
catch phrase that has become meaningless in its ubiquity. Through an
ethnographic study of a small elementary school in which community is
regularly invoked, the author identifies community's negative as well as
beneficial aspects and discusses the implications for schools.

    <h2>The Call for Community</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Decrying the apparent demise of civility in public and private lives, the call
for community in U.S. schools is strong. The narcissism of the 1960s, 1970s,
and 1980s left people in the 1990s self-absorbed and without the constancy and
safety of social lives (Elkind 1989; Gergen 1991). Popular media often
represent schools as sites of social contention, places where different
agendas, needs, concerns, and priorities intermingle. More urgently, the media
and other observers point to a lack of community as one of the causes of recent
violence in elementary, middle, and high schools. According to educational
observers, our schools and neighborhoods have lost the qualities of community
we remember or idealize from earlier days. In this time of disconnect,
educational reformers and social theorists increasingly call for improving
community in and around our schools. Community is both a problem (in its
absence) and a solution: Community is the ultimate good, it seems, for today's
society.  Even Congress agrees-in 1996, members of Congress held a weekend
retreat to restore the "civility" they felt they had lost along with community
(Lawrence 1996). Journalists and educational observers present community as the
latest educational panacea that will cure our pedagogical, cultural, and
sociological ills. We use the term glibly, with little pause to consider,
reflect, and share what we mean by it.
</p>

<p>
Is community an educational catch phrase? This paper considers various cultural
assumptions embedded within the term community.  Rather than discussing
community as a philosophical or sociological construct, as has been extensively
done in the research literature, this paper explores community in context,
defined in the daily lives of one group of students, teachers, and parents at
Oakleaf Country School.<sup>1</sup> Although the presence of community may seem
to be a bed of roses, I argue that that bed has thorns. This case study
provides initial support for my argument that generic calls for community
neglect the complex and potentially negative aspects of communities that have
important implications for schools.

    <h2>Researching and Theorizing Community</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Much of the school-community literature builds on the work of Ferdinand Tonnies
who defined community and society (Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, respectively)
as means by which we organize social interactions.  As an individual may be
involved in both Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft interactions, they are not
mutually exclusive concepts, although they are evolutionary. "In Gemeinschaft
with one's family, one lives from birth on, bound to it in weal and woe. One
goes into Gesellschaft as one goes into a strange country" (Tonnies
1988:33-34). Gemeinschaft thus accords with family as an organic social
organization driven by emotion. Gesellschaft represents the public life:
mechanical, artificial, and driven by reason.
</p>

<p>
A level of romanticism might be presumed in Tonnies' writing to suggest his
preference for community. Tonnies' work can be (and has been) read as a
moralized dichotomy in which Gemeinschaft is "good" and Gesellschaft is
"bad."<sup>2</sup> More recent authors have embraced the archetype of
Gemeinschaft in all its romantic possibility of an organic social organization
governed by self-knowledge, common values, and shared feelings. Yet
Gemeinschaft may not always be good when held up against the dysfunction and
abuse that can be manifested in the hegemony of a family. Samples argues that
Tonnies harbored no fondness for romanticism as he kept a critical eye on both
community and society.  "The communities of the past offered tyranny and lies
while modem society constructed new forms of domination through the remarkable
achievements of a refined rationality" (Tonnies 1988:xxi). Tonnies wrote not to
present empirical evidence but to sketch archetypes.
</p>

<p>
Current school-community literature, building on Tonnies, encompasses three
topical concerns, each with its own assumptions. Some educational reformers
focus on improving the quality of community within a school (Coleman and Hoffer
1987; Grant 1988; Hunderfund 1992; Meier 1995; Raywid 1988; Sergiovanni 1993;
Smrekar 1996) in accordance with Raywid's assertion that "It makes good sense
today to see the school's challenge as that of making school itself a strong
and unified modem community" (1988:203). The improvement of internal school
community, it is presumed, will foster children's moral development (Power et
al. 1989) and create an environment of respect, trust, caring, and honesty for
students and adults.
</p>

<p>
Graphic images of children shooting other children and teachers in U.S. schools
at the beginning of the 21st century provide an unquestionable urgency to
studying and changing social interactions inside schools. Youths accused of
perpetrating violence are characterized by the media as disaffected,
disconnected loners who communicate through violence rather than other,
socially constructive means. The basic argument is that if these youths had
felt strongly connected to a school community of "deep, horizontal comradeship"
(Anderson 1983:16), the violence would not have occurred. Although a lack of
community is not the only cause of disconnection in these students' lives
(overworked parents are another named culprit), calls for school community
continue the historical tradition of schools as social panaceas (Tyack 1974;
Urban and Wagoner 1996).
</p>

<p>
The second category of school-community literature argues for improved
communities as a requirement for a functioning democracy (Barber 1984; Etzioni
1993; Meier 1995; Power et al. 1989). Through the practice and experience of
being responsible community members in schools, it is argued, these young
people will participate as active citizens in society. Learning one's
individual rights should be accompanied by learning about and practicing one's
responsibilities. This literature builds generally from Dewey's strident calls
for schooling as democratic training ground. The experience of democracy must
take place within:
</p>

<blockquote>
an educational system where the process of moral-intellectual development is in
practice as well as in theory ... engaged in by free, independent human beings
who treat ideas and the heritage of the past as means and methods for the
future enrichment of life. [Dewey 1959:134]
</blockquote>

<p>
The third category of school-community literature calls for increased
connections between schools and neighborhoods, as well as schools and families
(Cibulka and Kritek 1996; Coleman and Hoffer 1987; Epstein 1990, 1995; Henry
1996; Martin 1992; Meier 1995; Rowe 1993; Rutherford and Billig 1995; Smrekar
1996). Better cooperation and communication between school personnel, families,
and residents in surrounding neighborhoods would enable the exchange of
resources and expertise, promoting academic and social benefits. This work
utilizes the relational aspects of community (school and nonschool member
interactions), as well as the geographic aspects (the physical structure of the
school and the surrounding neighborhood).
</p>

<p>
Concurrent with the above discussions of community, a small but growing body of
anthropological research explores the cultural dimensions of community.
Significantly, I find educational research on community rarely uses this
anthropological literature; instead, it relies on Tonnies or psychological
models of community. In contrast, the anthropological study of community
largely builds on Cohen's work (e.g., Church 1990; Markowitz 1992; Mitchell
1998) on the symbolic construction of community. Determining insider/outsider
status, normalizing specific behaviors, and utilizing nostalgia comprise three
community construction tools. This literature distinguishes itself from that
discussed above largely in its willingness to question the cultural assumptions
embedded in community usage.
</p>

<p>
From an anthropological perspective, community involves determining who is a
member of the community and who is not (Brow 1990; Church 1990; Counts and
Counts 1992; Maxwell 1998; Mitchell 1998). Insider/outsider status involves
familiar territory as anthropologists have long considered the distinction
between emic/etic perspectives, and our own movements in the field from
outsider to insider status. In their enlightening study of "RVers" (mostly
retired persons who tour and camp the United States in recreational vehicles),
Counts and Counts (1992) describe the rituals of greeting that occur as a
newcomer enters an RV camping area. After exchanging personal histories,
sharing photos, and providing local knowledge about the RV site, a newcomer may
transform from someone who cannot be trusted (an outsider) to a friend and
neighbor (an insider). The establishment of trust provides a building block for
community, and is often coincident with gaining and demonstrating specific
insider knowledge (Mitchell 1998).
</p>

<p>
Establishing insider/outsider status may be overtly accomplished through
geography (who lives on a city block, for example, or who is zoned for a
particular school), yet geography may not need to be a defining feature of
community (Counts and Counts 1992; Maxwell 1998).  Normalized behaviors are
potentially more salient (Counts and Counts 1992; Magolda 2000). "Normalizing
communities are based on those in power defining a cultural center or norm and
situating the 'others' on the margins" (Magolda 2000:38). These efforts support
insider/outsider status by establishing recognizable behaviors that indicate
the presence or lack of an individual's community membership. Normalizing
behaviors takes an additional step of defining "normal" within a community,
creating a moral hierarchy of who is more of a community member than another.
</p>

<p>
A more critical anthropological perspective on community has focused on the
prevalence of nostalgia within community construction (e.g., Brow 1990; Church
1990; Herzfeld 1997; Magolda 2000; Mitchell 1998).  Nostalgia may be readily
connected to an occurrence in the past that no longer exists, as in the case of
the former inhabitants of L-Arcipierku, an urban residential area in Malta that
had been demolished in the 1970s (Mitchell 1998). In the decades immediately
following the demolition, residents continued to discuss the area, including
recounting the organization of streets and the names of persons who had lived
in particular locales.  In addition to demonstrating their insider knowledge,
such invocations provided a means for a collective remembering of the familial
relations and "the openness and safety" of L-Arcipierku.
</p>

<p>
Nostalgia involves not merely a preference for the past, but also an assumption
that the past was more virtuous and morally certain. Constructing common
memories and moral certainties "produced an image of unity, completeness and
solidarity in L-Arcipierku, a kind of nostalgic Eden against which to judge the
present" (Mitchell 1998:87). Although it appears from Mitchell's account that
the invoked past actually existed, nostalgia may also invoke a mythic past that
exists only in current memory and discourse (Herzfeld 1997). Magolda recently
considered the campus tour presentation of a college that "firmly implanted in
the memory of tour participants a romanticized image of the lost American
college campus (which probably never existed), a campus where professors teach,
students learn and enjoy life, staff administer, and alumni treasure their
years on campus" (2000:40). Such imaginings invoke the nationalism discussions
of Anderson (1983) as well as the Greek sheepherders described captivatingly by
Herzfeld (1997, 1990).

    <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Although the current study concerns community within a school, it utilizes an
ethnographically based critique of cultural assumptions (Herzfeld 1997, 1990;
Marcus and Fischer 1986). To be critical is to ask questions that probe at
potentially negative effects, as when Lareau and Shumar (1996) explore the
negative consequences to family relationships that may result from mandated
parent involvement in schooling.  A critical perspective entails asking such
questions as, "Whose interests are being served?" and "Whose interests are
likely to be ignored?" (Magolda 2000:43). Such a perspective considers the
"underside" of social interactions (Smith 1998). As critical
participant/observer, I displace my own cherished and uncontested concepts
surrounding community.  "Critical ethnographers in education do not view such
categories as 'giftedness,' 'dropouts,' 'management,' 'public relations,'
'effective schools,' or even 'education' as nonproblematic. Rather, by placing
them in a more holistic social context, they are able to highlight their
ideological aspects and the interests that benefit from the maintenance of
current definitions" (Anderson 1989:253).
</p>

<p>
I critique categories such as "community," "parent involvement," and "good
schooling." Moving away from a priori definitions of these and other terms, I
turn to local constructions and examine the foundations of these local
constructs. In addition to exploring these assumptions, the larger study of
which this is a part utilizes the historical context of the school and its
members, placing the study in the sociohistorical context of postmodernity and
a reborn rural region (Gjelten 1982; Hargreaves 1994).
</p>

<p>
My critique, while it remains interested and biased, endeavors not to find
fault simplistically, but to provide an image for how things could be
otherwise. "It is here that the power of ethnography as cultural criticism
resides: since there are always multiple sides and multiple expressions of
possibilities active in any situation, some accommodating, others resistant to
dominant cultural trends or interpretations, ethnography as cultural criticism
locates alternatives by unearthing these multiple possibilities as they exist
in reality" (Marcus and Fischer 1986:116). Critical scholarship examines the
assumption that community necessarily represents an unquestioned, positive
element in society. Community has become an idealized concept through its
representation of a "way of life based on trust, honesty, respect for person
and property, service to community, and a strong sense of sexual propriety"
(Nugent 1996:259).  Critical authors advocate understanding the problematic
arenas and the virtues inherent in community. This work extends Matusov's
(1999) models of community maintenance, which privilege homogeneity over
difference. Such communities value "agreement and homogeneity and [devalue]
disagreement [and] diversity" (Matusov 1999:168). Like Magolda's (2000) study
of an American college, this article provides further support for Matusov's
argument.

    <h3>Studying Community</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
This study of Oakleaf Country School examined how, when, and in what contexts
school members invoked community during 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork in
the elementary school and its surrounding region. The small school is located
in an area considered by residents to be rural. As a participant observer, I
joined in events throughout the school day and beyond the school's walls. Much
of my time was occupied as a technology consultant, substitute teacher, reading
aide, and school aide. As a result, I was involved with classroom instruction
and school administration. I attended school functions in the evenings and on
weekends, including student performances, open houses, and board and teacher
meetings. I socialized with school parents at their homes and with teachers
after school, and spent time attending local events. In addition to extended
fieldwork, I conducted 21 interviews with school members. Observation notes,
interview transcripts, and my participation journal were discrete and
comparable data sets; all were coded for analysis. I also utilized archival
documents and a school survey. Two school members read my analysis and provided
feedback. In addition, throughout the process, I discussed my observations,
analyses, findings, and concerns with a peer debriefer.
</p>

<p>
I regard the fieldwork described above as "an art form" (Wolcott 1995). This
implies that ethnographic research and writing are not only technique, but also
embrace intuition and insight as part of the researcher's toolkit. As Peshkin
recounts of his ethnographic studies, "My subjectivity is the basis for the
story that I am able to tell. It is a strength on which I build" (Glesne and
Peshkin 1992:104). As an ethnographic researcher, I followed expectations of
rigor, validity, and accuracy. At the same time, I do not presume to have been
an objective observer. The more I participated in the school and its
activities, the more I became aware of filtering these activities through my
own values and concerns. I arrived predisposed positively to the school, and
left feeling that, if I had children of my own, they would do well to attend
Oakleaf. Judging from the conversations in which I was included, I
characterized my relationship with school members as an "insider." The more
trusted I felt by the Oakleaf community, the more "inside" activities I became
expected to take part in.

    <h2>Oakleaf Country School</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
In the foothills of the Virginia Piedmont, the crossroads hamlet of Oakleaf
boasted little beyond a small post office, three churches, and a few
professional offices such as a doctor and a contractor. Historically a farming
region, the area surrounding and including Oakleaf became gentrified as middle-
and upper-class families moved to the area, attracted by the rural lifestyle in
proximity to a thriving university town about ten miles distant.
</p>

<p>
The population of Foothill County and the unincorporated city of Springfield
was 108,381 in 1990. The county population, in particular, increased steadily
throughout the 1990s; the Springfield population also grew, although less
quickly. Both county and city populations were largely white (87 percent and 76
percent, respectively), with only ten percent of the county population and 21
percent of the city population black. About two percent of the total population
was Asian, and only one percent Hispanic. Local industries were primarily
agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and services. The socioeconomic
status of the Foothill County population was significantly higher than that of
Springfield, as measured by the median income of households, families, and the
percentage of families below poverty level (see Table 1). The gentrification of
the county during the 1990s included a tremendous growth in property values and
new home construction. As one school member observed in an April 1996
interview, "I notice the number of Mercedes keeps rising every year. We used to
show up in pick-up trucks."
</p>

<p>
In 1984, ten families founded Oakleaf Country School in response to their
dissatisfaction with local public elementary schools. Their primary concerns
were threefold: (1) redrawn district lines required their young children to
travel 90 minutes round-trip to school by bus; (2) parents did not feel that
their interests were being heard or served by the local school board; and (3)
parents wanted their children to attend a smaller, more creative school than
they felt was currently available in the public school system. In February
1984, parents met in a church basement to discuss their concerns. At that
meeting they decided to start their own school. In eight months the school
building was built and opened to admit the first ten students.
</p>

<p>
Parents decided to keep their small school independent in philosophy and
practice and, therefore, never affiliated with a religious organization or
specific educational philosophy (such as Waldorf or Montessori).  Dependent
upon tuition and fund-raising by local families and businesses, the small
school struggled financially throughout its first decade.  The school's
financial standing often left parents uncertain whether they would have funds
to open the following fall. Eventually, the school grew to its 1997 enrollment
of 55 students in grades kindergarten through fifth, as well as approximately
15 preschool students. Although the small size necessitated multigrade
classrooms at the start, multigrade classrooms remained a desired pedagogical
feature. It was believed that older and younger students working together
benefited everyone.
</p>

<p>
The first parents and teachers created the independent, unit-based curriculum
that emphasized individual and group research on topics from several
disciplinary perspectives. Textbooks served only as resources; the teachers
wrote nearly all of the curriculum.<sup>3</sup> Teachers often coordinated
their classes' work so that the entire school might conduct topical studies
together. These research projects often continued for weeks and took over the
school with displays and children seeking out and sharing their knowledge.
Classes often moved outside to make use of the rural setting with its trees,
pasture, and neighboring cows. Several times a year the school population was
joined by parents to plan and carry out a Thanksgiving program, a field day of
sports activities, reading days, overnight hikes and campouts, a May Day
celebration, and graduation.

    <h3>Community at Oakleaf</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
In many ways, Oakleaf appeared to satisfy what educational reformers call for
in a community. First and foremost, the school was small (Meier 1995). With
fewer than 50 families having children enrolled in the school, teachers knew
every student and parent by name. Parents were in the school throughout the day
and many knew all the students. Like many small rural schools, Oakleaf Country
School served as a regional center (Peshkin 1978, 1982). Local parades, cleanup
days, and community celebrations often took place at the school. Parents
exchanged local news while at the school to volunteer or pick up their
children.
</p>

<p>
Oakleaf being a small school, all of the children knew each other. They played
together on the playground and after school across age grades; older students
often read to younger students or assisted them in projects.  In addition, all
of the teachers knew all of the students by name. A scuffed knee on the
playground might be tended to by anyone.  Throughout my fieldwork there, I was
impressed with the absence of harsh words spoken by adults or children to each
other. I rarely observed the administration of punishment (such as a "time out"
or lost recess time), as it was used sparingly. For example, a rare punishment
of lost recess time was meted to a group of fourth and fifth grade boys who
goofed off during a fire drill. They were strongly admonished not only for
potentially endangering safety, but also for setting a poor example for the
younger students. Notably, they were merely required to sit out one 20-minute
session of recess as punishment.
</p>

<p>
By several measures, the school also became a successful academic place for
children. The research-based curriculum enabled students to pursue topics in
great depth. The children's enthusiasm for learning was apparent in their
immersion in topics such as the oceans, the rain forest, planning new
playground areas, and gardening. Students conducted country studies in which
each classroom studied one country, then shared their learning with the rest of
the school. Learning groups were not based solely on classroom groupings, but
on other combinations of students according to interest, ability, and variety
of ability. The work was frequently and truly collaborative as students
produced joint presentations, papers, projects, newspapers, and so on. Although
no longitudinal studies have been conducted to determine students' academic
achievement after leaving Oakleaf, anecdotal evidence suggests these students
remained highly motivated through middle and high school.  At the time I
conducted my research, the first graduates were just entering college. As an
example, one local public middle school teacher was so impressed with the
Oakleaf graduates who came through his classes that he enrolled his daughter
there.
</p>

<p>
Oakleafers regarded a parent's experience as testimony to the strength of the
school. Students, parents, and teachers repeatedly expressed devotion to the
small school; it was an "amazing place," the children "loved to go to school,"
and the school was "truly unique and special." The school did not administer
tests nor assign grades; teachers wrote lengthy narratives describing each
student's progress over the term. The narratives focused on how much the child
learned relative to his or her own learning. School members actively eschewed
ranking or comparing students.
</p>

<p>
The school was founded on a common goal-a type of education-that attracted the
families enrolled. These families enrolled by choice; they entered into school
relationships voluntarily. Many parents cited their reasons for choosing the
school as wanting the "creative, child-centered" pedagogy as well as a desire
for a geographically convenient school (Parent Survey 1995). Although the
school prided itself on strong academics, the school structure relied on
relationships between teachers, students, and parents to provide the foundation
of a good education (Baker et al. 1997).

    <h3>A Less Lovely Side of Community</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Oakleaf Country School was, in short, a wonderful place that could be described
in glowing terms at great length. As the months of fieldwork went by, my
enthusiasm for the school, inspired in part by the qualities described above,
did not wane. However, I became increasingly aware of problems and
disagreements that were aired privately. They were not part of the public
discourse of the school; rather, they emerged in offhand comments, one-on-one
conversations, and confidential interviews.  In nonpublic and anonymous
settings, parents and teachers described and revealed a less attractive side of
the school community.
</p>

<p>
At Oakleaf, parents and teachers described their involvement as an integral
part of their school community. School members enrolled in or worked at the
school by choice. Their voluntary participation would be considered an
attribute of community (King 1997). But among Oakleaf school members, to have
merely been enrolled in or working at the school was insufficient. To truly be
a community member, one must have been "involved." One reason parents founded
the school was because they were discouraged from being involved in local
elementary schools; Oakleaf was to have been different in this regard.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<em>Parent involvement.</em> From the outset, the ten founding families
envisioned a school in which families would be integral to, rather than
separate from, the school. Parents made most of the earliest decisions
including the physical design of the school, the criteria for selecting
teachers, and the creation of a governance structure. In addition, some parents
assisted in constructing the first two school rooms. The extent to which
parents actually became involved varied greatly among families over time. The
expectation of parent involvement initially "enrolled" every student's family
into the community. Consequently, if you enrolled your child at Oakleaf, you
accepted both your rights and responsibilities as a school parent. An excerpt
from a March 1987 school brochure makes this clear:
</p>

<blockquote>
Parents are expected to contribute time, expertise, and general support needed
for the efficient realization of the instructional program. This can be done
through direct classroom contact as a teacher's aide, building and grounds
maintenance work, Board and/or committee membership, organizing fund-raising
events, or materials development. [ ... ]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Parents are asked to share in the responsibility of setting positive examples
for the children, such as support for and cooperation with classroom teachers,
interest in assignments, and respect for School policies and procedures.  A
sincere commitment to and involvement in this School by parents is essential to
its proper functioning and to the realization of its goals; and the children,
families, and community are the beneficiaries of this commitment.<sup>4</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
Parents were asked, but not required, to volunteer at the school. If
involvement had been required, the school would have been considered a
cooperative. Parents would then have been required to spend a certain number of
hours each month at the school as part of their tuition contract.<sup>5</sup>
In the founding years and periodically since, the school considered adopting a
cooperative structure to ensure that all parents would be involved. However,
newer parents were considered less likely than the founding parents to agree to
a cooperative structure. In addition, as one parent argued, "It's the beauty of
this school, some parents can be involved if they want to." And, presumably,
some parents can not be involved if they want to.
</p>

<p>
The board and the parents always rejected the cooperative school option.  In an
April 1996 interview, one founding parent explained why:
</p>

<blockquote>
[We] talked about making [parent involvement] a requirement ... of tuition.
That was a way of keeping tuition low, like a cooperative. But we knew that
everybody couldn't do it. ... And it was felt that the people who did, did
because they wanted to. So the parents who hung out there, hung out because
they loved hanging out there. And that's what made it a special place.
</blockquote>

<p>
Parents were involved because they chose to be, not because they were required.
That voluntary action was what made the school unique: "It's the beauty of the
school."
</p>

<p>
Not all Oakleaf families, of course, contributed equal amounts of time and
money to the school. The involvement of Oakleaf parents ranged from those who
"just drop their check and their kid off" to those who were "core" or
"committed" families. "Core" suggests the families were considered to be more
dedicated to the school than others. Many parents and teachers characterized
core or committed families as the parents who did "all" of the volunteer work
at the school. Whatever the need would be,
</p>

<blockquote>
the same group of parents [did] all of the work. At work days it was always the
same group of parents, you'd see the same people on the Board. If there were
special projects, they were there.... If the gutter fell down, parents showed
up on the weekend. Anything that had to be done, it was always the committed
parents.
</blockquote>

<p>
Core families were easily recognized. The following "cultural prototype" (Van
Maanen 1988) characterizes the core family: a white, upper- to middle-class
married couple with two or three children; the family moved to Oakleaf from a
large urban center in another state. The family may have moved to the area
because of a faculty appointment at the university, but chose the region
because of its quiet, rural life: clean, safe, and close to, but not in,
metropolitan areas. The mother of the family drove a car pool and came inside
the school building at drop-off and pickup to check her mailbox and exchange
pleasantries with teachers and staff.<sup>6</sup> She was quick to sign up when
volunteers were needed for field trip car pools or school events. She offered
to organize fund-raisers such as the annual wreath sale. She worked at a job
only part-time, if at all, that allowed her time during the day to participate
in school events.  She brought her babies and toddlers with her to the school
where they were known and held by staff, teachers, and students. Her children
attended Oakleaf from preschool through fifth grade. She knew all the teachers
by name, and invited them to dinner in her home. Other school parents
constituted part of her circle of close friends, although they may not have
known each other prior to their children attending school together.  The father
spent a few years as a member of the board, attending monthly evening meetings
and drawing on his business contacts to secure resources for the school. The
father's employment, supplemented by investments, allowed the family to make
annual monetary contributions to the school beyond the tuition. In addition, if
the school required some money mid-year for a special project such as printing
raffle tickets, the family wrote a check on the spot.
</p>

<p>
A traditional sexual division of labor persisted among the core families and
was noted by school members: "I do feel that the parents that have done, for
example, the fund-raising efforts like the wreath-making, [are] really
primarily the mothers, the ones that are not working, primarily, that are able
to devote that kind of time to the school" (parent interview, December 4,
1996). Most of the visible adults at the school were women. School rhetoric
refers to both parents being equally involved, but most often it was women.
Women tended to perform daily and less public duties such as teaching,
volunteering in the classroom and on field trips, and organizing local
fund-raising projects such as making holiday wreaths. In contrast, men served
on the board of trustees, worked on construction projects, administered legal
concerns, and wrote grants. More mothers than fathers drove the car pools to
and from school, volunteered as teachers' aides in the classrooms, drove on
field trips, and cooked for the multitude of evening potluck dinners. All of
the school's directors and full-time teachers were women. Men served on the
board of trustees, which provided the more public and official face of the
school. Women served on the curriculum committee, which was responsible for
internal concerns such as curriculum, pedagogy, and school activities. Although
originally more men than women sat on the board of trustees, in later years
women gained the majority.
</p>

<p>
Although Oakleaf parents did not sign contracts requiring their involvement,
several social and structural forces effectively compelled participation. Those
"core" parents who contributed their labor to the school held social prestige,
received public accolades, and were even accorded moral authority. Social
interactions subtly and effectively coerced individuals into being involved or
expressing their desire to be involved in proscribed ways. When parents'
involvement slacked, they were reminded of the need for their efforts and that
they should regard the care of the school as their responsibility. One year,
the school director appealed to families at an annual parents' forum. As
parents came into the library for the meeting, she encouraged everyone to look
over the school every day. If parents saw something to be done, such as a
gutter falling off or trash to be picked up, they should simply take care of it
right there. She asked the parents to not come inside the school and tell her
what needed to be done. "This is your school. You have ownership of it. Just do
it. Help take care of it. I can't do it all myself." As she and other school
members explained to me, every parent ideally would feel involved and act on
that feeling by volunteering at the school. Such an appeal mirrors nostalgic
recollections of the founding families who gave freely of their time and energy
to build and run the school, but who did not necessarily have much money to
contribute.
</p>

<p>
Volunteering one's time, as the core families did, was privileged over simply
providing financial support. Although labor needs such as janitorial services
could be subcontracted, adults were needed for supervising field trips and
children at lunch time, and organizing fund-raising projects.
</p>

<blockquote>
The feeling of the school is volunteer, help out, and I just have this, what
may be a rather naive notion that when it's a school like Oakleaf that depends
on parents in some degree to raise money or have a project, that [the parents]
would all step in at some point and put in a little time. You know, sort of
just the sense of the spirit of the school and the community of the school
would ideally mean that a project, a fund-raising project, really would be
something that everybody helps out with, just everybody would pitch in. [parent
interview, December 4, 1996]
</blockquote>

<p>
This parent saw the spirit of the school community as manifested in the actions
of a core group of parents. If "everybody rallied," the school would fulfill
its goal of community. But the reality, she explained, fell short of her
expectation. Parents recognized that these and other responsibilities
continually left "a lot of time and work for a fewer number of parents to take
on" (parent interview, December 4, 1996). Parents were not required to do these
things, but received frequent imploring requests in the form of letters home,
newsletters, and conversations. Their volunteer efforts were described as being
essential to the school; without them, it was said, the school would not exist.
In addition, these actions received verbal praise at school gatherings, as
parents were repeatedly and profusely thanked. School interactions evidenced a
continuing tension: Although school members did not want to require others (or
be required) to be involved in the school, neither did they want a school where
parents simply dropped their children off in the morning and picked them up at
the end of the day. Oakleafers wanted a participatory community in which all
the members actively contributed. They wanted that participation to be made
freely, unasked for, and not required. But if you did not participate, "maybe
this isn't the right school for you."
</p>

<p>
Although parents paid $4,500 tuition per student for the 1996-97 elementary
school year, throughout the year they were asked to dig deeper to provide
additional resources. The enrollment contract specified only that parents pay
tuition. However, "it is [the parents'] job" to fund other needed, fundamental
resources such as regular building improvements.  Contributing to the teachers'
holiday bonuses, purchasing raffle tickets, and building the endowment were
activities that distinguished those families with "extra" money from those
without.
</p>

<p>
One consequence of this community involvement hierarchy was that some families
who considered themselves outside of the "core circle" described limiting their
investment of time and, to some extent, money.  They expressed reluctance in
attending external social events organized by parents such as the annual
Christmas party. An investment in the school seemed to be joined with an
investment in the social life of school parents. Not all parents were
interested in social commitments, especially if they did not expect their
children to remain at the school through fifth grade. As one family explained:
</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Tina:</strong>
I think there's like a core foundation, and there's a core foundation of
families that keep their kids all through there. Because it's a little
different to have your child there for one year and then you go. Versus saying,
okay, I know our family is going to be involved in this school, their child
being there in preschool through fifth grade, you're making a mental
commitment, too.  So you might approach things differently. So like we know if
June had stayed at Oakleaf, obviously we would have got to know families
better.
</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Jonas:</strong>
And we would be more involved, I know we would be.
</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong>Tina:</strong>
Definitely. And if we felt Mia was going to stay there [at the school], then we
probably would be going to that Christmas party [for the parents]. (laughter)
You know what I mean? If you know what your relationship is going to be,
there's only so much that you're going to invest in it. Because it doesn't make
sense to jump in with both feet and then go, knowing we're not going to be
around at all.
</p>

<p>
Because their children would only attend preschool at Oakleaf, this family
explained, they did not become too closely involved in the school (or with
other parents). They distanced themselves from those parents who enrolled their
children at Oakleaf through the end of fifth grade.  Staying through fifth
grade was characterized as being more committed to the school than those who
enrolled only for preschool. In contrast, a mother who decided to continue to
enroll her daughter after preschool described growing up with her child at the
school: "I now feel like I've wrapped my arms sort of much more around the
whole school." Understanding the social value of being involved in the school,
Tina and Jonas justified their lack of involvement by citing the limited time
each of their children would attend school at Oakleaf. They qualified their
statements by explaining how they nevertheless remained involved at some level:
"You know not everybody can do everything [at the school]. And so you know all
the hard core people at Oakleaf who do certain things. And we do what we can.
Or if we can't do it physically, then okay, we'll donate money or something
like that."
</p>

<p>
Tina and Jonas, like many others, resolved the apparent need for parent
involvement by explaining their inability, because of family circumstances, to
contribute time and labor. They felt it necessary to explain why they were not
more involved. In addition, they believed that other families would be there to
pick up the slack. Their own lack of in-kind involvement was justified by a
division of labor in which some families provided physical support for the
school while others provided monetary support. Yet core families who provided
physical support were often those who also readily contributed additional funds
to the school.
</p>

<p>
Although most school members agreed that every parent could choose what level
of participation they would have in the school, those parents who merely "write
their [tuition] check and drop their kid off," according to one parent, were
not looked upon as keeping with the traditions of the school. The Parent
Handbook reminded parents of these traditions: "[Oakleaf] was organized in 1984
by and for parents who wish to participate in the early years of their
children's schooling in a manner not available in any other setting in the
area. This has remained an important cornerstone of the school's mission."
Despite this encouragement, parents and some teachers complained that it was
always the same parents doing the majority of the necessary volunteer work. If
parents did not ever help in a fund-raiser or volunteer at the school, their
lack of participation would be quietly noticed and remembered by others.
</p>

<p>
A tiered system of involvement persisted. At the top were those core parents
who volunteered their time and contributed extra funds beyond tuition. Second
were those who volunteered their time only. Third were those who gave extra
money, such as Tina and Jonas. At the bottom were those parents who merely paid
tuition and "drop[ped] their kid off." In short, Oakleaf members represented a
high level of involvement among most of the parents as part of what defined the
school and, by extension, the community.
</p>

<blockquote>
You couldn't get to the point where we would mandate parent involvement.  It's
clear that if you're not really involved, maybe this isn't the right school for
you, I guess that's one way to look at it. But, I don't know, that's a
speculation.  You don't want to make people feel uncomfortable, but you also
feel like it's such a special school, out here in the country, with certain
values, why do you want to send your kids here if you don't want to be a little
part of that? [parent interview, December 11, 1996]
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">
As the school was never designed to be for every child, school membership
closely limited which families were appropriate for the school. The boundaries
were firm and clear.
</p>

<p class="noindent"><em>Teacher involvement.</em>
In the name of community, teachers often were
called upon to serve the school beyond the specifications of their contracts
and beyond comparable teachers' involvement in public elementary
schools. Because the school frequently faced financial challenges,
everyone was expected to "chip in." Money for school supplies, events,
and even professional development came out of teachers' pockets. This
historical tradition only slowly changed as the school became more
financially secure. To reach into one's own pocket was to go along with
the spirit of the school, to work in accordance with the founding sentiment.
To hesitate was considered a selfish or even an unkind act.
</p>

<p>
In addition, a teacher's private life was often constrained by obligations to
the school. In a disagreement over taking a holiday for religious reasons, a
teacher was criticized for prioritizing her own needs over those of the school.
Part of the issue was financial: Who should pay for the teacher's substitute,
the teacher or the school? The school director asserted that as the day was not
a school holiday (either for Oakleaf or in the public school system) the
teacher should pay for her substitute. The teacher offered to work on a day
when everyone else would take a holiday-still the issue of paying for the
substitute remained. The director contended that the teacher acted selfishly,
without considering the school's needs, thus framing the disagreement in
personal terms. The teacher felt that her personal needs were not respected
and, yet, should be, in a school that professes community, caring, and respect
for diversity, thus framing the disagreement as a school issue. The issue was
ultimately resolved when the director arranged a volunteer substitute.
</p>

<p>
Since the founding of Oakleaf, the line between parenting and teaching was
blurred. Until the hire of a teacher who then enrolled her children at the
school, none of the full-time teachers were also parents. Most of these women
teachers were single, although later teachers were in the first years of their
marriages. Although full-time teachers were rarely parents, many parents served
as part-time teachers and administrators.  One founding parent served as the
first school director (at the time an unpaid position). Several parents, mostly
mothers but a few fathers, worked in paid or unpaid positions as part-time
teachers. Part-time teachers taught "special" classes including physical
education, art, music, and foreign languages. One parent worked (for tuition
remission, not for pay) as a part-time administrative assistant. These parents,
in addition to those serving on the board of trustees and various committees,
remained intimately involved with the daily operation of the school and
individual classrooms.
</p>

<p>
Like parents, teachers were expected to provide their physical labor and
presence at school events beyond the school day. They were subtly chastened if
they did not attend extracurricular events such as holiday parties with
parents. Teachers were not "required" to attend these social events, but if
they did not they expected that would be "a problem." "It would manifest itself
in dirty looks the week we get back from Christmas, or a phone call, or
[pause]-I just know-there would be some repercussions to it" (teacher
interview, December 11, 1996). This same teacher resisted and resented any
coercion:
</p>

<blockquote>
The teachers are my family. I talk to Jennifer every night on the phone. You
know, our husbands are ready to kill us because we're never not talking....  So
on one level it's my family, because I choose to make that aspect of it my
family. When somebody forces it on me and tries to make it, tries to take it to
a different level, I resist it. Even though... the teachers I do consider my
closest friends in the world, it's still my job. Do you know what I mean? And
so where I can draw the line for myself, is one thing. But to ... force me to
go into a situation where the lines are muddled and the roles are supposed to
change and we're all supposed to be friends and we're all supposed to be
equals, it's not and it never will be. It's my job. I don't like going out on a
Friday night at 7:30 to mix with parents. It's not my choice.
</blockquote>

<p>
Other teachers felt that, ultimately, they could resist the pressures and
expectations to be personally involved with the school. Although they might
wish to regard their job as "just a job," most teachers found this impossible.
"I like to separate my job and my home. And I've always been told and warned by
teachers to do that. You can get sucked in, sucked in, so protect. Keep a
little distance. And you can't with this place, to a point" (teacher interview,
December 18, 1996). A teacher's personal involvement in the school seemed
inevitable.

    <h2>Problematizing Community</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Promoting community in every elementary school becomes more complicated in
light of the problems, as well as the benefits, of community at Oakleaf Country
School. I do not wish to suggest that schools should not endeavor to become
"healthy" communities. My concerns, however, are twofold: Schools may become
involved in a lot of community "talk" without a lot of community "action," and
schools, in their eagerness to build community, will neither consider nor
recognize the disservice that may result from coercive community
building.<sup>7</sup> My critical analysis, therefore, explores how community
is defined by asking, "Whose interests are being served?" and "Whose interests
are likely to be ignored?" (Magolda 2000:43).
</p>

<p>
By enlarging the educational discussion of community, I identify a
contextualized, native concept. Oakleafers praised community, both in general
and in the specific instance of their school. In addition to defining
themselves as a community, Oakleafers invoked reference to community in order
to get things done. However, when Oakleafers utilized community certain
qualities of negative social interactions emerged.
</p>

  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h3>Community Is Exclusive</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Oakleafers sought to construct social lives which were "transparent to one
another, relationships of mutual identification, social closeness and comfort"
(Young 1990:300). They established a school in which parents would be welcome,
in an attempt to create a place different from the public schools where they
felt excluded. They perceived the public school system as a closed system in
which only experts' voices (those of teachers, administrators, and school board
members) could be heard. At Oakleaf Country School, not only were parents
heard, their involvement was vital to the identity and functioning of the
school.
</p>

<p>
However, in the process of constructing a school inclusive of parents,
Oakleafers also built narrow parameters on community membership.  They
constructed a community that alienated others just as they themselves had felt
alienated. The long-standing rural population was "much less affluent [than
school parents]. There was always a hand-to-mouth existence" (former director
interview, May 6, 1996). "Nine years ago when we moved here [the local doctor]
told me one quarter of his patients didn't have running water or electricity"
(parent interview, April 10, 1996). These local families were unable to enroll
their children because of tuition fees and transportation costs, as well as
differences in social standing. This left a homogeneous student population in
terms of socioeconomic background and ethnicity at the school. Those parents
who could afford the tuition and other costs could obtain a safer, more
intimate, and, apparently, better education for their children.
</p>

<p>
The additional choices available to families of means are significant.  In a
society perceived to be violent and intrusive, those who can afford to,
increasingly seal themselves in enclaves (Gergen 1991; Orr 1992).  Even among
those families who enrolled their children at the school, some parents were
effectively excluded from the community because they were not involved as
"core" or "committed" families. Those families with two full-time working
parents, older children in other schools, or a single working parent could not
be as involved as families in which one parent did not work full-time.
</p>

  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h3>Community is Oppositional</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Oakleafers internally defined themselves through narratives of identity and
boundaries. To new families, those with a history of experience at the school
repeated oral accounts of notable school field trips, parent parties, and
beloved teachers. The group defined itself, however, also by its oppositional
identity. As in the founding days, insiders knew the school relative to other
schools in the area. Oakleaf defined itself by what kind of school it was not:
not religious, not preparatory, not public, and not affiliated with external
educational organizations.
</p>

<p>
This self-conception highlighted the boundaries between Oakleaf and other
schools. In and of itself, this may not be problematic. But the
boundary-defined identity was coupled with explicit statements of superiority
over other schools and parents. "Children [in public schools] don't feel that
every day is an adventure. The reason is that they're sitting in a classroom
like little robots for six hours.... Why couldn't we have an atmosphere where
our children could grow and enjoy it every day?... I just think that's common
sense that any parent would want for his child" (parent interview, April 18,
1996). Parents who chose not to send their children to Oakleaf were at times
characterized as not caring as much as Oakleafers did about education. Despite
the existence of a small scholarship fund, the $4,500-$5,000 annual tuition
prevented many families from ever enrolling in the school. Oakleafers contended
any family willing to sufficiently prioritize education over other material
needs could overcome this financial boundary. In practice, families already
enrolled often merely made a choice between a family vacation or tuition. Few
school families made a choice between food and shelter, and tuition.
</p>

<p>
By naming their school and its members unique, Oakleafers set themselves apart
from non-Oakleafers. Teachers asserted that only at Oakleaf could they teach
the way they wanted to teach. "It was such a joy teaching at Oakleaf" (former
director interview, April 15, 1996). Yet Oakleafers would not overtly describe
themselves as elite. They argued, "if everyone knew what we were doing, they
would see how good it is and they would do it too." They carefully manipulated
their eliteness while demonstrating egalitarianism. "I think that if there were
more schools like this in the country, the country would be a better place"
(parent interview, April 10, 1996).
</p>

    <h3>School Community is Gendered</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Although some students' fathers drove car pools, led field trips, and
volunteered at Oakleaf, the school was largely organized and run by women.
Oakleaf mothers, fathers, and teachers noted the predominance of women at all
levels of school organization and parent involvement.  That all of the
full-time teachers and most of the part-time teachers were women is not
surprising: 80 percent of all public elementary school teachers in the United
States are women. Teaching has, at least since the common school era, been a
female dominated profession. More significant at Oakleaf was the reliance on
mothers to provide most of the parent involvement. In particular, mothers who
worked outside of the home on a part-time basis or less made up the majority of
parents who were on hand at the school on a daily basis. That women perform
most of a school's parent involvement has been noted elsewhere (Henry 1996;
Lareau 1989; Smith 1998; Standing 1999).
</p>

<p>
This does not mean that fathers are not involved with their children's
education, but men's involvement may be more sporadic, while women's
involvement occurs daily. "Dads usually do the big stuff, the large projects
like building the bird cages, and women help with the homework and make sure
everything is taken care of for the children" (Henry 1996:74). At Oakleaf,
"everything" included attending parentteacher conferences; supervising
homework; preparing lunches; getting children dressed, fed breakfast, and off
to school; chaperoning field trips; and volunteering at the school. That daily
work required time, something not all families had in abundance. "Parental
involvement schemes implicitly depend on the existence of the nuclear,
two-parent family, with breadwinner father and stay-at-home wife and mother"
(Standing 1999:119). The burden of maintaining community fell
disproportionately on women."
</p>

<p>
In addition to these gendered issues of parent involvement, men and women at
Oakleaf used feminist styles of leadership and pedagogy. A feminist style of
leadership includes shared decision making, an emphasis on relationships, an
ethic of care and collaboration, negotiation, and child-centered decisions and
curriculum (Henry 1996). Group-centered activities, consensus, and attention to
emotional needs pervaded the school. To some extent, this feminist approach
changed as masculine constructs of competition (such as the administration of
tests and singular winners in sports events) became more prevalent.
Bureaucratic rules and organizational models such as delineated divisions of
labor began to exist between the board, director, teachers, and parents.

    <h3>Community is Coercive</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Parents and teachers received frequent requests to provide their labor and
financial and creative resources beyond the confines of their formal agreements
with the school. In the name of community, parents and teachers supported each
other professionally, personally, and emotionally.  Although all school members
expected some level of involvement, teachers especially articulated
inappropriate burdens placed on them.  The coercion was subtle: Teachers and
parents would not hesitate and did not begrudge assisting another teacher,
parent, or student in a time of need. However, they preferred to provide this
service out of personal regard for the individual and his or her exigencies.
The person assisting understood that the person in need could not fulfill his
or her obligation and there was an acceptable gap to be filled.
</p>

<p>
This school, presumably, was the kind of school that would attract parents and
teachers who want to be involved, and who don't need to be coerced into doing
so. The implicit message suggested that this school was better than others (a
special place) because parents willingly volunteered and teachers did more. At
other schools, parents and teachers were presumed either to not participate or
to do so only because of a contractual requirement.  In the spirit of "We're
all in this together," teachers in particular were called upon not only to
participate in the school as professionals, but on a personal level as well.
That demand ascribed a community member identity to teachers who might not have
asked for it.

    <h3>Community Is a Bed of Roses --- With Thorns</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
In our desire to improve our schools, neighborhoods, and cities, it is too easy
to lament that the community we once had has been lost along the way. Where was
this mythic community to which social observers idealistically refer? Are we
recalling the supposed close communities of the 1950s-communities that were
situated in a racist, nationalistic, and misogynistic society (Young 1990)?
Just as we presume "traditional families" once existed and have now been
dismantled (Coontz 1992), so too we presume that our idealized communities
actually existed and could somehow be regained. Our nostalgic images of
community misrepresent our past as well as our present. Community, like
chastity, becomes something that was supposedly more prevalent in a previous
generation (Herzfeld 1990).
</p>

<p>
Oakleafers outwardly presented community as an unproblematically positive
construct; this wholly positive stance appears inaccurate at best and coercive
at worst. When community is positive, the group can potentially hold too much
moral authority over the individual. Community then, in Young's (1990)
phrasing, "denies difference" by requiring all persons to follow particular
behavioral mores. Although a bed of roses may be beautiful, it is filled with
thorns. Likewise, the beauty of community masks coercive, exclusionary, and
homogenizing forces.  Young argues that community in and of itself is not
oppressive, but that within an oppressive society it can be used in that
manner: "I do not claim that the appeal to the ideal of community is itself
racist. Rather, my claim is that such appeals, within the context of a racist
and chauvinistic society, can validate the impulses that reproduce racist and
ethnically chauvinistic identification" (Young 1990:312).
</p>

<p>
If we discuss community as an active, complex, and changing creature, we will
not confine ourselves within an idea that community can only be perfect, whole,
and good. Recognizing the complexities opens up the possibility of change.
Young's statements stand directly on the mark:
</p>

<blockquote>
Instead of dichotomizing the pure and the impure into two stages of history or
two kinds of social relations, a liberating politics should conceive the social
process in which we move as a multiplicity of actions and structures which
cohere and contradict, some of them exploitative and some of them liberating.
The polarization between the impure, inauthentic society we live in and the
pure, authentic society we seek to institute detemporalizes the process of
change because it fails to articulate how we move from one to the other. If
institutional change is possible at all, it must begin from intervening in the
contradictions and tensions of existing society. [1990:315]
</blockquote>

<p>
Having learned about community from Oakleaf, I conceive of a community as a
successful marriage. Although two people may love each other dearly and be
terrifically happy together, every marriage has its difficult points, its sad
times, and its moments or days or weeks when the couple does not get along. If
the couple consider marriage only as a positive, wonderful experience, they
will be sorely disappointed and likely to give up when things (inevitably)
don't go so well. However, if they embrace and work through the "contradictions
and tensions," they may grow together and deepen their relationship, eventually

    <h3>Community Takes Work and Time</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">

<p>
Policy mandates for community in schools cannot expect immediate results
through top-down, scheduled activities. Oakleafers continually engaged in
community-building, both through periodic rituals and more mundane daily
interactions. Many of the daily interactions supported the community building
of rituals such as campouts and graduations.  However, some of the mundane
routines, such as teacher involvement, contradicted the school's apparent
community. In a similar manner, I suggest that all schools cannot merely adopt
sporadic "community-building" activities such as pep rallies and potlucks. If
the interim between events contradicts the meaning of the events-that is, if in
everyday practice people go about their business in anticommunity ways-then the
mere introduction of a ritualized community-building event will not be valid. I
became nervous when Oakleaf began to schedule "community building" once a week.
Would their naming community as an event compartmentalize it and segregate it
from daily living?  Or could this become a new ritual that would further
reinforce their daily efforts? Investing sufficient time so that relationships
and trust are built among school members appears to be especially challenging
in the current standards-based environment of school reform.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, policies that merely declare an increase in community, like those
that declare increased parent involvement, may too easily rely on nostalgic
remembrances of community. Instead, policies should be places of imagining new
structures of community, as Smith argues is needed, to address issues of
families and schools: "Problems with schools, schooling, and young people are
represented as being the responsibility of families rather than as calling for
a retooling of public educational institutions to respond to new demands"
(1998:13). Policy makers should promote meaningful community, rather than
merely any community (Lareau and Shumar 1996).
</p>

<p>
"Families in lower income groups have less access to resources, skills, and
time than those in middle-class areas where women with young children are
married to men earning incomes sufficient to free their unpaid labor for the
educational work supporting not just their own children, but the general level
of the schools their children attend" (Smith 1998:20). The solution does not
fall in the neoconservative movement to keep women out of the workforce and in
marriages, for that movement does not acknowledge the gains made by women (and
men) as well as the inevitability of changing family structures and the
financial necessities of many families (Lareau 1989; Smith 1998). Rather, we
need to alter institutional structures of schooling and parent involvement. Our
concern for community in our schools must be coupled with social activism
whereby we actively affect larger cultural changes.
</p>

    <h3>Community Requires Change</h3>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Just as we limit ourselves if we require current communities to mirror
idealized and mythic communities of the past, so educational leaders limit
reform possibilities by representing community as a fixed entity.  Community is
about flux, adaptation, and change. Oakleafers became anxious when the
institutional maturation required more financial involvement and less physical
involvement from parents. They perceived these changes to be threats to the
community and identity of the school.  If school leaders could embrace change
and even expect that the appearance of the community will change over time,
they might not fall prey to nostalgic limitations. Community as a
developmental, rather than a static, concept, holds opportunity for change ever
present in any system (Matusov 1999).
</p>

<p>
King (1997) suggests that in our current era, our communities may be best based
on "common work tasks" rather than more generalized and pervasive ties. Within
our postmodern society with new habits of interaction and living and work
arrangements, our communities may no longer be based on multiple levels of
social knowledge and interaction.  Bellah et al. (1996), Hargreaves (1994),
Sergiovanni (1993), and many others contend that individuals are no longer
connected to each other through traditional anchors such as family, place, and
religion. Our new school and classroom communities may require new anchors such
as common work tasks that do not necessarily provide or entail lifelong social
relationships. Community today, therefore, may not mirror the community of
yesterday. Our community leadership needs to embrace that inconsistency and
tolerate the ambiguity of communities in change.

    <h2>Limitations of Gemeinschaft</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Researchers would do well to find new ways of writing about community.  Most
writings on education and community fetishistically refer to Gemeinschaft
(T6nnies 1988). However, the term depersonalizes community by removing it from
the lived articulation of community as family and as a group of people.
Discussing community as Gemeinschaft primarily represents community as a level
of social structure, somewhere between family and society. It does not evoke
the deep meanings ascribed to community in the current depersonalized,
postmodern society. Researchers who wish their work to speak to practitioners
need to close the gulf between practice and theory constructed by the term
Gemeinschaft.  Anthropologists have produced strong, critical work on
community, but we have not, apparently, taken this work to educators.
</p>

<p>
The present work speaks to the cultural desire for community and examines our
assumptions that community is persistently benevolent. In that arena this study
resembles Matusov's (1999) work, but pushes a point he leaves unexplored: In
his study of a small school, Matusov concludes that an ecological model of
community, which embraces difference and change, best captures that school's
construct. He leaves unanswered whether all school members buy into the
ecological model or not; that is, whether it is a construct they use
themselves. It is that point of potential disagreement over meaning-where some
school members define community differently than others-with which I am
concerned.  The different meanings are particularly salient when the prevailing
construct is one of sameness. Our communities exist within a "racist and
chauvinistic society" (Young 1990:312) that will not change through improved
school communities alone.
</p>

<p>
Although the school in the current study represents a singular aspect of formal
education in the United States, many of the features and uses of community at
the school reflect efforts made at other, larger schools.  Against the constant
conversation about community and schools taking place both in academic and
public venues, it may appear that schools and society benefit from increased
attention to community. However, I challenge this assumption out of an interest
to more fully consider its implications.  I problematize community as a means
of understanding its complexity and going beyond simplistic assumptions of its
value. If community truly represents something beneficial to our schools and
civic life, we should understand what the term "community" represents.  By
removing the blanket and vague depiction made of community as shared values and
a sense of connectedness, we might understand why community seems to be missing
from our lives.

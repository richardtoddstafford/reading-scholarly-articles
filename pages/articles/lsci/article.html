    <h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Polar bears were studied near Churchill, Manitoba, to evaluate the possible
importance of supplemental food. Once ashore, bears became segregated by
age and sex; family groups and pregnant females moved inland into a denning
area, while single bears, especially adult males, remained along the coast.
Bears were inactive and fed little. Analysis of blood samples taken from
bears in the denning area suggested that they also were not feeding. By
remaining inactive, they are able to minimize energetic demands and the
chance of hyperthermia. After 2 months ashore, some bears, mainly family
groups and subadults, fed in the Churchill dump. The data indicated that
individual needs and learning were major factors determining which bears
used the dump. Adult males did not feed there even though they may have
been there previously as cubs or subadults. Bears which fed in the dump
were significantly heavier than those which did not. There was no evidence
that bears using the dump gained either reproductive or survival
advantages. We conclude that polar bears will use supplemental food sources
which are available or if they have previously learned their location;
however, it is not necessary for their survival.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) primarily prey upon ringed seals
(<em>Phoca hispida</em>) and the larger but less abundant bearded seals
(<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) (Stirling and Archibald 1977; Smith 1980).
They typically feed on the blubber (Stirling and McEwan 1975), a
high-energy food source (Schmidt-Nielsen 1975). Polar bears are also
opportunistic feeders and will scav- enge on the carcasses of walrus
(Odobenus rosmarus), beluga whales (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>), and
bowhead whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) (Lentfer 1972; Uspenski and
Kistchinski 1972; Christiansen 1981).
</p>

<p>
The subpopulation of polar bears resident in southwestern Hudson Bay spends
several months ashore each year (Stirling et al. 1977). From mid-November
to late July, all polar bears, except denning females, are out on the sea
ice hunting seals.  Family groups emerge from dens and move onto the sea
ice in late February and March. However, from late July to mid- November,
when Hudson Bay is ice free, polar bears are ashore along the coasts of
Manitoba and Ontario (Russell 1975; Jonkel et al. 1976; Stirling et al.
1977). Thus, it is important for these bears to accumulate adequate fat
reserves for the entire period they spend ashore, because there will
probably be no adequate alternative food sources.
</p>

<p>
Russell (1975) documented food habits of polar bears during summer and
autumn, but was unable to determine how often they fed. Latour (1981 a)
observed at Cape Churchill that while ashore, polar bears remaining
inactive (70.8% of the observed time) and fed very little (1.25% of the
observed time). Knudsen (1978) found that on the islands in James Bay,
polar bears were inactive 86.8% of the observed time and fed for 3.2% of
the observed time.
</p>

<p>
The Churchill dump is one reliable source of food available to polar bears
in northeastern Manitoba during the period they spend on land. This food
source is used by approximately 1% of the total population and primarily
from October to mid- November. The use of dumps as food sources by both
black bears (Ursus americanus) (Rogers et al. 1976; Young and Ruff 1982;
Herrero 1983) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) (Craig- head and Craighead
1971; Mundy and Flook 1973; McCul- lough 1982) has been well documented in
the literature.

This study compares polar bears that used food from the dump while ashore
to those that did not. It evaluates the nutri- tional and behavioral
strategies which polar bears have evolved to enable them to spend an
extended period of time away from primary food Sources.

    <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Research was conducted along the western coast of Hudson Bay in northeastern
Manitoba. Patterns of ice formation and breakup on Hud- son Bay have been
documented (Larnder 1968; Danielson 1971). The study area lies within the
Hudson Bay Lowlands (Ritchie 1962) and was divided into five parts: denning,
coast I, coast 2, intermediate, and dump areas (Fig. I). The topography, flora,
and fauna of these areas have been described (Stirling et at. 1977; Lunn 1985).
The width of the coastal strip was arbitrarily set at 5 km. Limited access to
the coastal areas by track and all-terrain vehicles extended as far east as
Knight's Hill. As the effect that limited human activity may have on polar
bears was unknown and there were few observations of bears in this area, the
coastal region was divided into two: coast I and coast 2.  The dump area was
arbitrarily defined to encompass the area within a 3 km radius of the town
garbage dump. The dump was created in the 1960's and is now approximately 150 m
long, 75 m wide, and 20 m high.
</p>

<p>
Since 1966, the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Wildlife Branch of the
Manitoba Department of Natural Resources have been involved in ecological
studies of polar bears in Manitoba (Ramsay and Stirling 1982). Many polar bears
have been tagged and the resultant data are in the national data base stored by
the Canadian Wildlife Service in the University of Alberta computer. Using
preexisting computer programs, information pertaining to the age-classes and
sex classes of polar bears, previous captpre histories, weights, and other
information on all polar bears captured by researchers, killed as problem
bears, or shot by Inuit hunters could be extracted. The data were analyzed
using the Michigan interactive data analysis system (MIDAS; Fox and Guire
1976). Field observations were divided into two seasons, summer
(July-September) and fall (OctOber-December), as polar bears did not typically
feed in the Churchill dump until October.
</p>

<p>
Polar bears were captured using methods described by Lentfer (1968), Stirling
et at. (1977), and Stirling ef at. (1980). Blood samples were collected from
some individuals and analyzed for urea and cre- atinine levels by Dr. R. Nelson
at the Carle Foundation Hospital.  University of Illinois, Urbana, IL. Nelson
ef at. (1973) and Nelson et at. (1983) found that mean urea: creatinine ratios
of non feeding black bears during winter sleep were < 10, while those for
feeding black bears were> 10. For the purposes of determining whether polar
bears were feeding, we also used 10 as the critical value. A premolar was
extracted for age determination using methods similar to Thomas and Bandy
(1973). Based on this age, each bear was placed in one of the following
classes: (i) cub of the year (COY), less than I year old; (ii) yearling,
between I and 2 years old; (iii) subadult, ages 2-4 years; (iv) adult, 5 years
or older.
</p>

<p>
Adult females not accompanied by cubs of any age were classified as solitary,
whereas adult females and accompanying offspring were classified as family
groups. Up to 40% of the adult female polar bears in Manitoba show a 2-year
breeding cycle as opposed to the more usual 3-year cycle in more northerly
populations (Ramsay and Stirling 1982); therefore, a number of yearling bears
may be on their own.  These bears were classified as independent yearlings. Any
bear with- out cubs that had no known age was placed in the category "un-
known." Activities of bears that were handled were not recorded until 3 days
after capture to minimize the chance that their observed behavior could be
influenced by drugs.
</p>

<p>
Activities of polar bears were observed over 2.5 years. We observed bears in
the coast 2 area from II July to 8 August 1982 and from 27 July to 24 august
1983. We spent 26 days (24 September to 19 October) in the coast 2 area during
the fall of 1983. We also observed bears at the Churchill dump for three
successive fall periods: 5 October to II November 1981 , 24 September to 14
November 1982, and 12 September to 23 September and 20 October to 4 November
1983.
</p>

<p>
Most polar bears in the coast 2 area were observed from either a 13.5-m tower
at Cape Churchill or from a 6-m tower situated 12 km south of Cape Churchill.
We also observed polar bears from the ground after we had located them by
travelling along gravel beach ridges on all-terrain cycles. Observations were
made using Leitz Trinovid 10 x 40 binoculars of Bausch and Lomb 15-60x zoom
spotting scopes. In the dump area, bears were observed from a vehicle parked
200 m to the northwest. As all observations were made between 0700 and 1930,
the data were biased towards daylight hours.
</p>

<p>
Observed activities were placed into one of the following catego- ries. (i)
Foraging: feeding or looking for food within a 100 m area.  (ii) Travelling:
walking or running through an area without stopping, except for short « I min)
rests or swimming over 10 m in one direc- tion. (iii) Resting: lying, standing,
sitting, or walking or swimming less than 10 m in one direction. (iv)
Aggressive interactions: hissing, charging, locking of jaws, or swiping with
front paws with or without contact. Less overt aggression was not detectable,
therefore, aggres- sion may be underrepresented in the time budgets. (v)
Nonaggressive interactions: social play, such as described by Latour (198Ib),
between two or more bears.
</p>

<p>
An arc sine transformation was used to make comparisons between time budgets
(Sokal and Rohlf 1981).

    <h2>Results</h2>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Once ashore, polar bears tended to segregate by age- class and sex class.
Throughout the summer and fall, adult males were found mainly in the coast 2
area and solitary adult females were found in the denning area. Subadult
females were more evenly distributed, while subadult males tended to be found
in the coast 2 and dump areas. Although family groups were found primarily in
the denning area, some were in the dump area. However, a significantly greater
number (G-test, 0,025 < p < 0.05) of family groups were caught in the dump area
in the fall than in the summer. Only 17% (7 of 41) of family groups caught
during the summers from 1966 through 1983 were in the dump, whereas in the
fall, 33% (42 of 127) of family groups were caught there.
</p>

<p>
As we did not observe activities of any bears in the inter- mediate area and
only 27 bears have been caught there since 1966, we did not include this area
in any analyses.
</p>

<p>
Female bears caught in the denning area were significantly older (t-tests, p <
0.00 I) than females caught in any other area. The mean ages of females caught
in the coast I (n = 60), coast 2 (n = 64), and dump (n = 102) areas were 4.5 ±
3.9, 5.4 ± 5.0, and 5.4 ± 5.1 years, respectively. However, the mean age of
females caught in the denning (n = 113) was 10.4 ± 5.5. Males caught in the
coast 2 or denning areas were significantly older (t-tests, p < 0.001) than
those caught in the dump or coast I areas. Mean ages of males caught in the
coast I (n = 63) and dump (n = 118) areas were 3.6 ± 3.3 and 3.4 ± 2.9 years,
respectively; while in the coast 2 (n = 165) and Denning (n = 33) areas, the
mean ages of males caught were 7.2 ± 5.5 and 7.5 ± 5.1 years, respectively.
</p>

<p>
A significantly greater number (G-test, p < 0.001) of fe- males than males
caught in the dump area were over 6 years of age. Of all females caught there,
30% (31 of 102) were older than 6 years. By contrast, only 7% (8 of 118) of
males were older than 6 years.
</p>

<p>
In the coast 2 area, a total of 299.7 h of activity was observed on 100 polar
bears during the summers of 1982 and 1983 and 570.6 h of activity was observed
on 91 bears in the autumn of 1983 (Table I). There were no observations of
independent yearling males in this area. Resting was the most dominant
activity. While resting, most bears lay in daybeds in the grass along the
coast. A daybed was an area of flattened grass, approximately 2 m x I m, formed
by the weight of a lying bear. Family groups moved more than single bears.
After about I week ashore, family groups began to move inland. Cubs were
usually active and thus probably caused their mothers to travel.  Most other
bears made short movements between daybeds once or twice each day. Members of
family groups were the only ones observed feeding, mostly on moss and the seed
heads of grasses, Even so, feeding accounted for only 2% of their total
activity. Although numerous flocks of flightless geese were present in the
coast 2 area throughout the summer, no polar bears were observed attempting to
capture them. No bears, including members of the same family group, were
observed interacting aggressively or nonaggressively.
</p>

<p>
It was not possible to observe the behavior of polar bears in the denning area.
However, it was possible to determine if they were feeding by the analysis of
samples of blood collected from bears captured in this area and comparing these
results with those from bears in areas where activities of bears have been
observed. The mean urea: creatinine ratio was significantly higher (t -tests, p
< 0.00 I) for bears feeding in the dump than in other areas. The mean urea:
creatinine ratio for bears in the dump area (n = 16) was 22.0 ± 12.9 and
suggested they were feeding. Direct observations of bears in this area
confirmed this. Mean urea: creatinine ratios of bears in the denning (n = 60)
and coast 2 (n = 75) areas were 9.0 ± 5.3 and 7.9 ± 4.5, respectively, and were
not significantly different (t-test, 0.1 < p < 0.2). These means suggested that
bears in these two areas were not feeding. Observations in the coast 2 area
also supported the conclusion drawn from the blood analysis. We concluded, by
inference, that bears in the denning area also did not feed to any great
extent.
</p>

<p>
During the autumns of 1981 and 1982, a total 683.2 h of observations was made
on 82 polar bears (Table 2). Resting was not as common in the dump area as it
was in the coast 2 area, which may reflect a tendency for polar bears not to
rest in the same areas where they feed. As expected, foraging accounted for a
much greater percentage of the observed activ- ities of bears in this area.
Garbage was delivered around 1100 and 1500 on 4 days. Most bears that foraged
in the dump arrived between 0800 and 1000 and left between 1700 and 1900. After
they left each afternoon, individual bears tended to select specific resting
sites within a 2 km radius of the dump.  These resting areas were used
throughout the fall.
</p>

<p>
The mean duration of all nonaggressive encounters was 19 min (n = 32) and
varied in length from 2 to 66 min. These interactions usually involved two
bears, although on two sepa- rate occasions three bears were involved, and
primarily oc- curred in the grassy areas adjacent to the dump.
</p>

<p>
Aggressive interactions did occur in the dump area. They accounted for less
than I % of the activity budget for all groups but one. We considered a bear to
have won an interaction when the other bear ceased interacting and moved away.
Aggressive interactions were brief, their mean duration (n = 52) was 1.2 min,
and ranged from 1 to 3 min. Except for one encounter, all were inititated by
adult females with cubs. Aggression usu- ally resulted from COntact between a
female's cubs and other bears. Family groups WOnall but I of the 51 bouts they
initiated and were the most dominant bears.
</p>

<p>
In 1983, bears came into the dump more than a month earlier (late August
compared with early October) and there were about twice as many (20 vs. 10-11)
as in the previous 2 years.  We observed 27 bears for a total of 532 h of
activity (Table 3).  There was a significant difference (G test, p < 0.05) in
the percentage of time accounted for by each activity between 1981 - 1982 and
1983 for bears of each age-class a~d sex class observed in the dump area,
except for subadult males and females. Family groups and unknown bears foraged
less and rested more during 1983 than in 1981-1982.  Adult males foraged more
in 1983 than in 1981 - 1982. All groups of bears travelled less in 1983 than in
the previous two autumns. Except for family groups, the percentage of
nonaggressive interactions remained the same or decreased from 1981-1982. The
mean duration of all nonaggressive encounters (n = 44) was 18 min and varied
from 2 to 50 min. Although family groups did not engage in nonaggressive
interactions in 1981-1982, in 1983 this activity accounted for 6% of their time
budgets. The per- centage of aggressive interactions decreased in 1983. The
mean duration of these encounters (n = II) was I min and ranged from I to 2
min. As in the previous two seasons, family groups were dominant, as they Won
all 10 bouts.
</p>

<p>
Since 1966, 33 individual adult females, caught and tagged in the Churchill
dump, have brought 57 litters (101 offspring) there. Thirty-nine percent (13 of
33) of these adult females have returned to the dump in subsequent years with
different litters. One female has returned with four different litters and One
has returned with five different litters. Once weaned, 21 % (15 of 72) of the
offspring were known to have returned to the dump. One female cub that went
there with her mother sub- sequently returned with two different litters of her
Own.  Since 1966, 207 individual bears have been captured in the Churchill
dump; of these, 67 (32%) have been recaptured there in years subsequent to
their first capture. One female caught there in 1967 has returned almost every
other year over the past 16 years. Two females have each returned to the dump
over a IO-year time span, while three females have returned over an II-year
period. However, males did not return as often as females even if they were in
the dump as cubs. A total of 23 cubs and subadults that were originally caught
in the dump have not returned there but have been recaught as adults else-
where. Of this total, 2 males (9%) and 2 females (9%) were recaptured in the
Denning area, while 17 males (74%) and 2 females (9%) were recaptured along the
coast.
</p>

<p>
Except for COY females, there were no significant differ- ences (t-tests, p >
0.05) between weights of bears in the dump and other areas in the summer. COY
females in the dump area were significantly heavier (I-test, 0.01 < P < 0.02)
than those not there. It appeared that bears of each and sex class came ashore
in comparable nutritional condition. By autumn, non- feeding bears had lost
weight. Six groups of bears that did not feed in the dump were significantly
lighter (t-tests, p < 0.05) in the autumn than they were in the summer (Table
4). By contrast, there were no significant differences (t-tests, p > 0.05)
between summer and autumn weights of bears feeding in the dump. From these
data, it was clear that there was a nutri- tional benefit to some groups of
bears that fed in the dump.
</p>

<p>
To examine benefits to individuals, some bears were cap- tured twice in I year.
Except for one subadult female, bears in the coast I and coast 2 areas (n = 16)
lost between 0.3 and 0.4% of their total initial body weight per day. Bears in
the denning area did not lose weight (n = I) or lost (n = 5) between 0.1 and
0.8% of their total initial body weight per day.  In contrast, individual bears
foraging in the dump gained (n = 26) between 0.1 and 0.6% of total initial body
weight per day or showed no weight loss (n = 3).
</p>

<p>
It appeared that once ashore, all bears lost weight. Bears that foraged in the
dump were able to replace the lost weight prior to going back onto the sea ice.
However, this nutritional benefit did not appear to translate into a
reproductive benefit. There was no significant difference (Hest, 0.5 < P < 0.9)
between the mean litter size of bears that foraged in the dump (x ± SE, 1.8 ±
0.7; n = 58) and those that did not forage there (x ± SE, 1.7 ± 0.6; n = 152).
</p>

<p>
It was not possible to get an accurate estimation of survivor- ship; however, a
crude value based on recapture was deter- mined. Of the total number of polar
bears that have fed in the dump and could have been recaptured, 49% (89 of 183)
were recaptured throughout the entire study area in subsequent years.
Essentially 100% of bears in the dump are captured each year; therefore, it was
necessary to weight those bears caught in other areas but never in the dump, as
they had about a 30% chance of capture. We weighted one-third of these bears
(33) by a factor of 3 113 to compensate for this capture bias. The weighted
recapture rate was 43% (176 of 410). Although the method was admittedly
subjective, there appeared to be no advantage or disadvantage, in terms of
survivorship, to those bears that fed in the dump.
</p>

<p>
One bear that fed in the dump was found dead within 200 m of the site. Two
pieces of lead batteries were found in the stomach. We concluded that this bear
probably poisoned itself.  There was no way to determine how many bears poison
them- selves while feeding in the dump, but the large number of tagged bears
that have returned in subsequent years suggested that accidental poisonings
were rare.
</p>

<p>
Each autumn, some polar bears enter the town of Churchill, cause problems, and
have to be destroyed. A significantly higher number of tagged bears that have
fed in the dump have been destroyed as problems (G-test, p < 0.001). Of 207
tagged bears that have fed there, 12% (24) have been destroyed as problem bears
compared with only 2% (II of 496) of tagged bears that have not fed there. Of
the 24 "dump" bears that were destroyed, 19 were subadult males.
</p>

<p>
When Hudson Bay freezes, polar bears move north along the Keewatin coast, where
some are hunted by Inuit from several communities. A significantly higher
number of tagged polar bears that have fed in the dump were harvested (G-test,
p < 0.001). Of 496 tagged bears not feeding in the dump, 4% (19) have been
shot, while 8% (17 of 207) of tagged bears that have fed in the dump have been
killed. As before, most of these "dump" bears were subadult males.

</div>

  <div class="col-sm-12">

<p>
Segregation did not appear to result from competition for resources, as no
interactions were observed between any bears.  This may be based on the
avoidance of males by family groups.  Intraspecific mortality of polar bears
has been reported (Russell 1975). Intraspecific mortality caused by adult male
black bears (Kemp 1976; Rogers 1977; Beecham 1980) and brown bears (Troyer and
Hansel 1962; McCullough 1981; Stringham 1983) has also been reported, but some
cases involved trapped ani- mals. Therefore, the extent to which it occurs in
these species under natural conditions is still unclear.
</p>

<p>
Over shorter distances, female polar bears with cubs are probably able to
outrun adult males; however, over longer distances cubs may tire. Though adult
females will defend their cubs, it is probably a better strategy for the
survival of family groups to move inland.
</p>

<p>
Both Knudsen (1978) and Latour (1981 a) documented that while ashore, polar
bears were mainly inactive and fed very little. Over the past 20 years,
scientists have conducted re- search on geese in the coast 2 area. M. Gillespie
(personal communication) indicated that bears had been observed walking through
flocks of flightless geese many times but no attempts were made to capture
them.  Polar bears are inefficient walkers (Best 1982; Hurst et al.  1982) and
are subject to hyperthermia during the warm season (0ritsland 1970; Best 1982).
Hurst et al. (1982) studied polar bear locomotion and derived the following
equation to measure oxygen consumption:
</p>

<p>
[1] VO<sub>2</sub> = 0.62e<sup>0.06v<sup>1.5</sup></sup>
</p>

<p>
where VOz is oxygen consumption in millilitres of Oz per gram per hour, e is
the base of the natural log (2.718), and v is walking speed in kilometres per
hour. Using this equation and the body composition of female lesser snow geese
(Anser cae- rulescens) (Ankney and MacInnes 1978), it was estimated that a
320-kg bear running at 20 kmlh would have to catch a goose in approximately 12
s to be energy efficient. We assumed that (i) bears only used fat as an energy
source, (ii) body com- position of geese in Churchill was similar to that of
geese at the McConnell River, N.W.T., and (iii) bears would only feed on
protein and fat reserves as was observed at the dump. Chasing geese would also
increase the chance of hyperthermia by in- creasing the amount of metabolic
heat to dissipate.
</p>

<p>
As a large and reliable food source, the Churchill dump has existed since the
early 1960's (Stirling et al. 1977). In this relatively short period of time,
some polar bears have learned its location and have shown a high degree of
seasonal fidelity.  An individual may learn the location of a particular
resource from its mother, from other bears, or by positive reinforcement of
investigative behaviors (McCullough 1982). The number of cubs that have
returned to the dump, once weaned, suggests that these bears have learned the
location of the Churchill dump from their mothers.
</p>

<p>
Bears, in general, are opportunistic feeders and are adept at locating food
sources by smell. Polar bears that investigate dump smells will be rewarded. By
continuing to feed there, an individual may learn its location and return in
subsequent years. Other studies have shown that black and brown bears learn
locations of food sources and return in subsequent years (Craighead and
Craighead 1971; Luque and Stokes 1976; Rogers et al. 11J76; Rogers 1977;
McCullough 1982).
</p>

<p>
On the sea ice, independent yearlings, subadults, and family groups may be
displaced from their kills by larger, more dom- inant bears (Stirling 1974).
Consequently, these bears may have more difficulty maintaining adequate fat
reserves. In addi- tion to basal metabolic needs, smaller bears have energetic
costs associated with growth and females with cubs have ener- getic costs of
milk production. Therefore, once ashore, they are more likely to become
nutritionally stressed than bears that do not have these added costs. Any bear
that has learned the location of a food source, such as a dump, might be
expected to use that source if it becomes nutritionally stressed.
</p>

<p>
As males reach the age of 5 or 6 years, they approach adult size and would be
expected to have less energetic demands than other age-classes and sex classes
of bears. As they are older and larger, probably more experienced and competent
hunters, and more capable of defending their kills than younger bears;
therefore, they may feed more often. Once ashore, adult males appear to have
sufficient fat reserves to draw upon throughout the summer and therefore may
not become nutritionally stressed. This differs from what has been observed for
both black bears (Rogers et ai. 1976; Rogers 1977) and brown bears (Craighead
and Craighead 1971; Stonorov and Stokes 1972; Luque and Stokes 1976), where
males continued to use supple- mental food sources, whether natural or
artificial, regardless of their age.
</p>

<p>
The limited amount of observed aggression between polar bears and the dominant
status of females with cubs differs from studies of black bears at dumps
(Rogers 1977; Herrero 1983) and brown bears (Stonorov and Stokes 1972; Egbert
and Stokes 1976) at salmon streams where, typically, adult males are dom- inant
because of their larger size. This difference probably occurs because few adult
males use the Churchill dump and polar bears have different energetic
requirements than do other bear species at this time of year. As black and
brown bears den in the fall, it is important that they build up adequate fat
re- serves for use during the winter denning period (Rogers 1976; Beeman and
Pelton 1980; Nelson et al. 1983). Therefore, black and brown bears may be more
aggressive at concentrated food sources in an effort to maximize the amount of
stored fat reserves that they build up before denning. Polar bears move back
onto the sea ice and begin hunting seals by the end of November, except for
pregnant females which have already denned and do not feed in the dump anyway.
Therefore, it is not critical for polar bears to build up fat reserves prior to
going back onto the sea ice.
</p>

<p>
There are potential advantages to using a supplemental food source. First of
all, bears feeding in the dump were signifi- cantly heavier than their
nonfeeding counterparts. Other studies of supplemental feeding have shown
similar results. For exam- ple, Rogers et al. (1976) reported that black bears
feeding in garbage dumps in northern Michigan were significantly heavier than
their counterparts not feeding in dumps. Populations of white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus) (Ozoga and Verme 1982) and Japanese monkeys
(Macacafuscata) (Sugiyama and Ohsawa 1982) that received supplemental feed were
signifi- cantly heavier than populations that did not.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage of a supplemental food source is the potential of increased
survival of nutritionally stressed individ- uals. Although we demonstrated that
bears lost weight once ashore and that bears in the dump were able to replace
this lost weight, no increased survival of dump bears was found.
</p>

<p>
A third potential advantage is that female bears that feed while ashore may be
able to produce more offspring per litter than bears that do not. Adult females
that feed should be able to maintain higher levels of stored fat that can be
used to meet the energetic needs of raising offspring. Rogers (1976) reported
that female black bears that did not gain sufficient weight prior to denning
usually failed to produce cubs. We found that there was no apparent
reproductive advantage, as measured by litter size, to females that fed in the
dump.
</p>

<p>
Black bears that fed in dumps had significantly higher mean litter sizes than
nondump bears (Rogers et al. 1976). However, these data need to be put into
perspective. Female black bears that feed in dumps den and give birth to cubs
within 3-4 months. Any reproductive advantage is realized within a rela- tively
short time after feeding. Female polar bears in the dump go out onto the sea
ice during the winter, mate, and, at the earliest, would den 12 months later.
During that time span, all pregnant females, regardless of whether they fed or
not while ashore, have had the opportunity to feed on seals and built up fat
reserves prior to entering dens and giving birth.
</p>

<p>
Individual need probably determines when and if bears use the dump. Bears of
each age-class and sex class were of similar weight when they came ashore.
Those bears with higher ener- getic demands should use up their reserves
faster. Although it was not possible to determine when bears became
nutritionally stressed, it may have occurred around the onset of their use of
the dump at the end of September. Major movements of bears back towards the
coast' do not begin until the end of October.  Therefore, most bears that fed
in the dump did not do so as a result of an overall movement back towards the
coast. The lack of adult males in the dump, a group that should be the least
nutritionally stressed, further suggested that the nutritional con- dition of
individual bears was important in determining when it was used.
</p>

<p>
Polar bears will use supplemental food sources if they are available, or if
they have learned their locations, but most bears do not have to. As most bears
probably catch seals within a few days of returning to the sea ice, the
nutritional advantage that polar bears feeding on shore have over nonfeeding
bears does not appear to be critical. It appears that polar bears are well
evolved to deal with a 3- or 4-month period with little or no access to food.

    <h3>Help with this tool</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Reading Scholarly Articles</strong> is designed to help students 
      understand the components and
      overall structure of scholarly research papers. It draws on the expertise of 
      subject area librarians, advanced undergraduates, and graduate students to 
      provide explanatory annotations of representative scholarly articles in a number
      of different disciplines.
    </p>

    <h4>Navigation</h4>
    <p>
      You can always click "Help" on the "Scholarly Articles" menu at the top left of the
      screen to return to this help file. Articles representing different disciplines
      may also be selected using the dropdown menu in the navigation bar. 
    </p>

    <h4>Annotated Articles</h4>
    <p>
      You will find highlighted components in each example article. 
      These highlighted components or <emph>annotations</emph> can be
      viewed by clicking an annotation <emph>trigger</emph>. Annotations
      look like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="example-trigger">
        <div rel="annotation" class="row">
          This is what the annotated components of articles look like. Click on these
          areas to see the annotation. If it was a real annotation, a popover would appear 
          describing or analyzing this component of the article.
        </div>
      </div>
    </p>

	<h4>Popover Annotations</h4>
	<p>
		When you click on the annotation trigger, a popover will appear like this:	

    <div class="popover-example">
      <div class="popover bottom">
        <div class="arrow"></div>
        <h3 class="popover-title">Popover Annotations</h3>
        <div class="popover-content">
          <p>The annotations will describe, analyze, and provide context which helps
          	understand a particular part of the scholarly article. To close an annotation
          	and continue reading, click anywhere outside the popover.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

	<h4>Field Descriptions</h4>
		<p>Each representative article is supplemented with a <emph>field description</emph> 
      page. The field description provides a brief introduction
      to the field, highlights important concepts and disciplinary norms, and answers
      common questions about how scholarship is carried out in the field.</p>
